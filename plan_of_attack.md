## things

exposures: asbestos, silica, cigarettes, viruses, gord, iron

mediators: Nalp3 inflammasome, IL-1B, MUC5b, AMs, Bugs

outcome(s): IPF, dyspnoea

## techniques

case-control study (IPFJES)

asbestos exposure measurement (JEM + source receptor model) - done
silica exposure measurement development

genotypes - MUC5b done, ?CHRNA5
?exome sequencing

phenotypes - pleural plaques - are they more common in UIP/ILA? automated
pleural plaque identification and UIP/ILA identification using computational
methods, lung function + genotype?
