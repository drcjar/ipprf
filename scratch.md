## proposal is to do work to get an intermediate fellowship for 2 years; need a good question!

## need to check out intermediate fellowship awards and cross-correlate with 'research gaps'

research gaps can be identified by:

- cochrane reviews, other systematic reviews
- NICE recommendations for research
- PSP lind alliance
- PPI

## needs to be a problem that matters; need a good question!

## RDS might be able to help

## avoid sequential plans

## plays to my skillset / data and collaborations already have

-- occupational lung disease
-- ipf
-- dna & serum & occupational histories
-- I can program

## potential bill and mirium collaboration + bioinformatics person

## ideas arising from thesis

Planned future work includes further study of non-asbestos occupational exposures in IPF, augmentation of the study data with pulmonary function test measurements, a mendelian randomisation study of smoking in IPF, and antibody characterisation of serum collected from participants with a view to investigating the possibility of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis IPF misclassification.
