## proposal is to do work to get an intermediate fellowship for 2 years; need a good question!

## need to check out intermediate fellowship awards and cross-correlate with 'research gaps'

research gaps can be identified by:

- cochrane reviews, other systematic reviews
- NICE recommendations for research
- PSP lind alliance
- PPI

## needs to be a problem that matters; need a good question!

## RDS might be able to help

## avoid sequential plans

## plays to my skillset / data and collaborations already have

-- occupational lung disease
-- ipf
-- dna & serum & occupational histories
-- I can program

## potential bill and mirium collaboration + bioinformatics person

## ideas arising from thesis

Planned future work includes further study of non-asbestos occupational exposures in IPF, augmentation of the study data with pulmonary function test measurements, a mendelian randomisation study of smoking in IPF, and antibody characterisation of serum collected from participants with a view to investigating the possibility of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis IPF misclassification.

## what I've done so far

- review of occupational exposures in ipf, shortcomings of previous work
- ipfjes 
1. have found asbestos alone is not a risk factor for IPF and no evidence of GE with muc5b

## what I've also found

2. have also found: 
- some cases (and controls) have heavy exposures 
- asbestos + smoking is associated with ipf (effect confined to those with 1 or more muc5b disease allele)
- asbestos exposure is associated with dyspnoea
- associations with stone, metal, wood
3. it would be interesting, important, achievable to know:
- is smoking really a risk for ipf (MR study); snps assoc with heavier smoking exposure (insturmental variables) are randomly dist; can use to overcome residual confouding and establish more accurate relationship between smoking and ipf
- IV measured smoking might also enable better understanding / char of interaction with asbestos exposure in ipf
- ??other genetic factors in ipf and occupational interactions
- otehr exposures in ipf given is signal for stone, metal, wood. need to measure better.
- something on chp misclassification
