## proposal is to do work to get an intermediate fellowship for 2 years; need a good question!

## need to check out intermediate fellowship awards and cross-correlate with 'research gaps'

research gaps can be identified by:

- cochrane reviews, other systematic reviews
- NICE recommendations for research
- PSP lind alliance
- PPI

## needs to be a problem that matters; need a good question!

## RDS might be able to help

## avoid sequential plans

## plays to my skillset / data and collaborations already have

-- occupational lung disease
-- ipf
-- dna & serum & occupational histories
-- I can program

## potential bill and mirium collaboration + bioinformatics person

## ideas arising from thesis

Planned future work includes further study of non-asbestos occupational exposures in IPF, augmentation of the study data with pulmonary function test measurements, a mendelian randomisation study of smoking in IPF, and antibody characterisation of serum collected from participants with a view to investigating the possibility of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis IPF misclassification.

## what I've done so far

- review of occupational exposures in ipf, shortcomings of previous work
- ipfjes 
-- have found asbestos alone is not a risk factor for IPF and no evidence of GE with muc5b

## what I've also found

- some cases (and controls) have heavy exposures 
- asbestos + smoking is associated with ipf (effect confined to those with 1 or more muc5b disease allele)
- asbestos exposure is associated with dyspnoea
- associations with stone, metal, wood

## it would be interesting, important, achievable to know:
- is smoking really a risk for ipf (MR study); snps assoc with heavier smoking exposure (insturmental variables) e.g https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs16969968  are randomly dist; can use to overcome residual confouding and establish more accurate relationship between smoking and ipf
- IV measured smoking might also enable better understanding / char of interaction with asbestos exposure in ipf
- ??other genetic factors in ipf and occupational interactions
- otehr exposures in ipf given is signal for stone, metal, wood. need to measure better.
- ? use MR to look at Iron in IPF https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6586257/
- something on chp misclassification

MUC5b promotor snp is biggest risk factor genetic or otherwise for IPF. Its associated with increased MUC5b expression.

Muc5b overexpression causes mucociliary dysfunction and enhances lung fibrosis in mice. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07768-9

 Lung Microbiota Contribute to Pulmonary Inflammation and Disease Progression in Pulmonary Fibrosis; germ free mice die less readily in response to bleomycin injury https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1164/rccm.201809-1650OC
 
 IPF patients have a higher bacterial burden https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201403-0541OC 
 
 increased proportions of AMs lacking surface CD71 (the transferrin receptor) in human patients with IPF; probably results in more available iron for bugs and more bugs
 
 ??? muc5b snp assoc with prolonged survival.
 
 ??? patients possessing a minor allele have a lower bacterial burden.
