## what I've done so far

- review of occupational exposures in ipf, shortcomings of previous work
- ipfjes 
-- have found asbestos alone is not a risk factor for IPF and no evidence of GE with muc5b

## what I've also found

- some cases (and controls) have heavy exposures 
- asbestos + smoking is associated with ipf (effect confined to those with 1 or more muc5b disease allele)
- asbestos exposure is associated with dyspnoea
- associations with stone, metal, wood

## what I'd like to do 

- **bring new methods to occupational lung disease research** such as:

- explore doing mendelian randomisation (MR) studies in IPF e.g smoking https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs16969968, iron https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6586257/, GORD https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11968-2
- triangulation is valuable in aetiological epidemiology; MR can augment case-control studies; not yet used in occupational epidemiology
- we can use IPFJES exposure histories and DNA together with our expertise and collaborations to get off the ground
- imaging analysis e.g automated pleural plaque detection in a large screening CT thorax dataset
