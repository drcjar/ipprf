  Abstract                 = {This review assesses the contribution of occupational asbestos exposure to the occurrence of mesothelioma and lung cancer in Europe. Available information on national asbestos consumption, proportions of the population exposed, and exposure levels is summarized. Population-based studies from various European regions on occupational asbestos exposure, mesothelioma, and lung cancer are reviewed. Asbestos consumption in 1994 ranged, per capita, between 0. 004 kg in northern Europe and 2.4 kg in the former Soviet Union. Population surveys from northern Europe indicate that 15 to 30\% of the male (and a few percent of the female) population has ever had occupational exposure to asbestos, mainly in construction (75\% in Finland) or in shipyards. Studies on mesothelioma combining occupational history with biologic exposure indices indicate occupational asbestos exposure in 62 to 85\% of the cases. Population attributable risks for lung cancer among males range between 2 and 50\% for definite asbestos exposure. After exclusion of the most extreme values because of methodologic aspects, most of the remaining estimates are within the range of 10 to 20\%. Estimates of women are lower. Extrapolation of the results to national figures would decrease the estimates. Norwegian estimates indicate that one-third of expected asbestos-related lung cancers might be avoided if former asbestos workers quit smoking. The combination of a current high asbestos consumption per capita, high exposure levels, and high underlying lung cancer rates in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union suggests that the lung cancers will arise from the smoking-asbestos interaction should be a major concern.},

  Abstract                 = {The present article reports on two conceptual and methodological issues concerning interstitial lung disease (ILD) about which there is a lot of misunderstanding and contradiction: the investigation of epidemics and clusters and the classification and epidemiology of ILD. In general, an epidemic is the occurrence of cases of an illness in excess of normal expectancy. The investigation of an epidemic often demands a number of sequential studies: first descriptive, then aetiological. Clusters consist of an increase in incidence of much smaller magnitude, perhaps excluding the possibility that this is merely a result of chance. In recent years, more valid statistical methods for the assessment of clusters have developed. For interstitial lung disease in particular, different classifications exist that are sometimes inconsistent and may change with time. All diseases require a process of ascertainment, whereby they are identified, classified and perhaps registered. The two most employed epidemiological techniques for testing aetiological hypotheses are the cohort and case-referent approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {Increased prevalence of chronic interstitial pneumonia (CIP) is reported in dust-exposed subjects. We investigated the prevalence of CIP in silicosis and mixed-dust pneumoconiosis and sought morphologic differences of CIP between the pneumoconiosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).We reviewed CT scans of 243 silicosis and mixed-dust pneumoconiosis patients to identify any cases of parenchymal lung lesions showing a CIP pattern, and compared the CT findings with those of 62 patients with IPF. Two observers independently scored CT images and classified the CT pattern as typical or not typical for IPF. Differences were sought between the groups using a nonparametric test, Fisher exact test, and a logistic regression analysis. A radiopathologic correlation was performed in 11 pneumoconiosis patients.Twenty-eight patients (11.5\%) showed CIP on CT. Seven patients (25\%) showed a pattern not typical of IPF, while the remaining patients showed a pattern typical of IPF, 11 of which were confirmed pathologically. The extent of fibrosis did not differ between the groups; however, patients with pneumoconiosis showed less traction bronchiectasis (odds ratio [OR], 0.19; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.08 to 0.48; p < 0.001), more subpleural homogeneous attenuation (OR, 2.56; 95\% CI, 1.55 to 4.23; p < 0.001), and fibrosis was more randomly distributed (OR, 315.38; 95\% CI, 4.68 to 21244.63; p = 0.007). Pathologically, subpleural homogeneous attenuation corresponded to dense fibrosis often with abundant silicotic nodules.Prevalence of CIP in pneumoconiosis was approximately 12\% on CT. One fourth of patients showed an atypical IPF pattern, and the others showed a typical IPF pattern.},

  Abstract                 = {Random error (misclassification) in exposure measurements usually biases a relative risk, regression coefficient, or other effect measure towards the null value (no association). The most important exception is Berkson type error, which causes little or no bias. Berkson type error arises, in particular, due to use of group average exposure in place of individual values. Random error in exposure measurements, Berkson or otherwise, reduces the power of a study, making it more likely that real associations are not detected. Random error in confounding variables compromises the control of their effect, leaving residual confounding. Random error in a variable that modifies the effect of exposure on health--for example, an indicator of susceptibility--tends to diminish the observed modification of effect, but error in the exposure can create a supurious appearance of modification. Methods are available to correct for bias (but not generally power loss) due to measurement error, if information on the magnitude and type of error is available. These methods can be complicated to use, however, and should be used cautiously as "correction" can magnify confounding if it is present.},

  Abstract                 = {Thirty-five necropsied cases of diffuse malignant mesothelioma of pleura and six cases of mesothelioma of peritoneum are reported. Occupational histories from 40 cases showed that 32 cases (80\%) were definitely exposed to asbestos; six cases (15\%) were probably exposed and two (5\%) had no known exposure. The mean latent interval was 34 years. Occupational histories of 56 control patients matched in pairs for age and sex with 28 of the mesothelioma cases revealed definite exposure to asbestos in 12 controls (21\%), probable exposure in 11 (20\%), and no evidence of exposure in 33 (59\%). The difference in incidence of exposure between mesotheliomas and controls is statistically highly significant. Six-micron histological sections of lung, available in 39 mesothelioma cases, contained coated asbestos fibres in 36 cases (92\%). Sixteen cases of mesothelioma showing fibres were free of asbestosis; asbestosis was slight in 14 cases, moderately severe in five cases, and severe in one case. The incidence of asbestos bodies in sections from mesothelioma cases was significantly higher than in a previously reported series of routine necropsies examined by lung smear. Counts of coated and uncoated asbestos fibres were performed on samples of lung tissue from 33 mesothelioma cases. No fibres were identified in one case and only occasional coated fibres in a second case. The remainder gave counts ranging from 154 thousand to 684 million fibres per gram dry weight. Uncoated fibres were invariably present and usually comprised 50 to 80\% of the count. No relationship was found between total fibre count and the latent period of the mesothelioma. Fibre counts were also performed on lung samples from 18 smear-positive and 30 smear-negative routine necropsies. Cases with numerous coated fibres in the smear gave total fibre counts similar to those of mesothelioma cases without asbestosis. Routine cases with only one fibre in the smear usually yielded only occasional fibres on analysis. Coated and uncoated fibres were found in 13 out of 30 smear-negative cases, indicating a true incidence of 56\% of exposure to asbestos in the whole necropsy series. When compared with the mesothelioma series the difference in incidence of fibres remains statistically significant. The data suggest that, on Tyneside, exposure to asbestos sufficient to cause an appreciable risk of developing mesothelioma has usually occurred through occupational exposure rather than by general environmental pollution by asbestos.},

Occupational and environmental exposures were studied in several countries and found to play important role in the disease development. However, in Egypt, a little attention has been paid to study the effect of these factors in the disease development.To identify the occupational and environmental risk factors associated with the development of IPF in Egypt.A multicenter hospital-based case-control study was carried out in chest hospitals affiliated to three Egyptian cities-Cairo, Tanta and Mansoura. Subjects were 201 patients with confirmed IPF (cases) and 205 age-, sex- and residence-matched controls. Data on occupational and environmental factors were obtained from a questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent risk factors of IPF in both sexes for single factors with adjustment for age, residence and smoking status.Compared with the controls, the risk of IPF in male workers was observed to increase significantly in chemical and petrochemical industries and carpentry and wood working (OR = 2.56, 95\% CI: 1.02-7.01), and with occupational exposures to wood dust and wood preservatives. Among female workers, a significant increase was observed in farming (OR = 3.34, 95\% CI: 1.17-10.12), raising birds and occupational exposures to animal feeds, products and dusts and pesticides. Risk of IPF decreased significantly in male workers and insignificantly among female workers in sales and clerical related activities. The environmental exposures to birds and cats were significantly associated with elevated risk of IPF development in both sexes.In Egypt, farming, raising birds and wood working are important risk factors for the development of IPF.},

The questionnaire asked for information on smoking habits, occupational airborne exposure and respiratory disorders.A random sample of 4992 subjects from the general population aged 15-70 years of Hordaland County, Norway.The overall response rate was 90\%, with a 63\% response to the initial letter. The response rates to the first and second reminder letters were 56\% and 36\% respectively. In 20\% of the non-respondents an uncompleted questionnaire was returned with cause for non-response; in two thirds of these the cause for non-response was that the subject was not resident at the mailing address. A home visit to a random sample of 50 urban non-respondents provided further information on 29 subjects. A wrong address at the Central Population Registry and the subject's feeling of lack of personal benefit from a postal survey were the major reasons for non-response. Smokers were late respondents and subjects with respiratory disorders tended to be early respondents.The main reasons for non-response were a wrong mailing address and a feeling of lack of personal benefit from responding. Using only the initial letter would have changed the estimated prevalence of smokers from 39\% to 35\%. Otherwise, the estimated prevalence of the exposure and disease variables as well as the associations between them were only slightly changed after including the respondents to the first and second reminder letters.},

  Abstract                 = {Occupational exposures were investigated in a multicenter case-control study of clinically and histologically diagnosed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic diffuse interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. Results are based on 248 cases, aged 20-75 years, diagnosed at 16 referral centers between January 1989 and July 1993. There were 491 controls ascertained by random digit dialing and matched to cases on sex, age, and geographic region. Data were collected using a standard telephone questionnaire. Occupational factors were based on a detailed history of jobs lasting 6 months or more and job activity, hobby, and specific substance checklists. Several occupational factors, adjusted for age and smoking in conditional multivariate logistic regression analyses, were significantly associated with IPF: farming (odds ratio (OR) = 1.6, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 2.5); livestock (OR = 2.7, 95\% CI: 1.3, 5.5); hairdressing (OR = 4.4, 95\% CI: 1.2, 16.3); metal dust (OR = 2.0, 95\% CI: 1.0, 4.0); raising birds (OR = 4.7, 95\% CI: 1.6, 14.1); stone cutting/polishing (OR = 3.9, 95\% CI: 1.2, 12.7); and vegetable dust/animal dust (OR = 4.7, 95\% CI: 2.1, 10.4). Interaction was detected between smoking and exposure to livestock (p = 0.06) and farming (p = 0.08). Results confirm previous studies showing increased risk associated with dusty environments.},

The study included 248 cases, and 491 control subjects identified through random-digit dialing, matched to cases in sex, age, and geographic region. Telephone interviews were conducted with both cases and controls to collect information on potential risk factors for IPF, including smoking and household, occupational, and environmental exposures. Pulmonary function tests, X-rays, computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest, and lung biopsy reports were submitted by referring centers to support the diagnoses. An a priori hypothesis that smoking is associated with IPF was examined with conditional logistic regression analyses. More cases (72\%) than control subjects (63\%) had a history of ever smoking. The odds ratio (OR) for ever smoking was 1.6 (95\% CI: 1.1 to 2.4). Risk was significantly elevated for former smokers (OR = 1.9; 95\% CI: 1.3 to 2.9) and for smokers with 21 to 40 pack-yr (OR = 2.3; 95\% CI: 1.3 to 3.8). A history of smoking is associated with an increased risk for the development of IPF. Although there was no clear exposure-response pattern with cumulative consumption of cigarettes, there was a trend for time since cessation of smoking, with the highest risk for those who had most recently quit.},

  Abstract                 = {idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a generally fatal disorder with a reported median survival of 3 to 6 yr. This has been based on relatively few studies with diagnoses inconsistently confirmed by ade- quate lung biopsy. Retrospective analysis of 104 patients with IPF who had open lung biopsy (OLB) at Mayo Medical Center from 1976 to 1985 was performed to establish the overall survival rate, the spectrum of histopathological subgroups and their associated prognostic significance. The study group consisted of 54 men and 50 women with a median age of 63 yr. Median survival was 3.8 yr af- ter diagnosis by OLB with an estimated 10 yr survival of 27%. Current histopathologic review showed a heterogeneous group including usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), desquamative interstitial pneu- monia (DIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia/fibrosis (NSIP), acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), bronchiolitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and others. Median survival of the UIP group was 2.8 yr which is significantly worse (p ? 0.001) than for other subgroups of chronic interstitial pneumonias. IPF includes several histopathologic subgroups with significantly different survival rates. Patients with UIP have worse survival than patients with other types of idiopathic chronic interstitial pneumonias including NSIP. Accurate histopathologic classification is essential for prognostication in patients with IPF. Bjoraker JA, Ryu JH, Edwin MK, Myers JL, Tazelaar HD, Schroeder DR, Offord KP.

The aim of the study is to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory features of PAP in a large single-center cohort of patients with PAP. Over 30 years, 70 patients with PAP were managed at our institution, 64 with primary and 6 with secondary PAP. The mean age at diagnosis was 43 years with a male to female ratio of 1.3. BAL was the most commonly applied diagnostic method, performed in 83% of cases. A history of smoking was seen in 79%, and of dust exposure in 54%, most commonly to aluminum, silica and sawdust. GM-CSF autoantibody correlated with clinical outcome and KL-6 with diffusing capacity. The number of whole lung lavages (WLL) necessary to reach remission was higher in current smokers. This study shows that the use of BAL for the diagnosis of PAP can reduce the need of histological confirmation. A history of dust or fume inhalation is strongly associated with PAP, also with the autoimmune form. Smoking seems to influence the response to treatment, increasing the number of WLL necessary to reach remission.},

For each job, exposure assessments for asbestos and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were obtained by expertise (TBQ expertise) and by algorithm using the TBQ (TBQ algorithm) as well as by expert appraisals based on all available occupational data (REFERENCE expertise) considered to be the gold standard. Additionally, a Job Exposure Matrix (JEM)-based evaluation for asbestos was also obtained. On the 497 jobs, the various evaluations were contrasted using Cohen's κ coefficient of agreement. Additionally, on the total case-control population, the asbestos dose-response relationship based on the TBQ algorithm was compared with the JEM-based assessment.Regarding asbestos, the TBQ-exposure estimates agreed well with the REFERENCE estimate (TBQ expertise: level-weighted κ (lwk)=0.68; TBQ algorithm: lwk=0.61) but less so with the JEM estimate (TBQ expertise: lwk=0.31; TBQ algorithm: lwk=0.26). Regarding PAHs, the agreements between REFERENCE expertise and TBQ were less good (TBQ expertise: lwk=0.43; TBQ algorithm: lwk=0.36). In the case-control study analysis, the dose-response relationship between lung cancer and cumulative asbestos based on the JEM is less steep than with the TBQ-algorithm exposure assessment and statistically non-significant.Asbestos-exposure estimates based on the TBQ were consistent with the REFERENCE expertise and yielded a steeper dose-response relationship than the JEM. For PAHs, results were less clear.},

  Abstract                 = {Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare, diffuse infiltrative lung disease of unknown etiology characterized by accumulation of abnormal lung surfactant in the alveoli and distal airways. Although it was first described in 1958, few large scale studies have been published. The diagnosis is conventionally based on lung biopsy and the value of less invasive procedures such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) remains controversial. A multi-center retrospective study was conducted in an attempt to update epidemiological, clinical and long term outcome and to assess the usefulness of chest CT scan and BAL in the management of a large homogeneous series of 41 patients. Inclusion criteria required a clinical picture compatible with PAP and either histological confirmation, or a BAL with a milky macroscopic appearance coupled with positive staining to PAS. Mean age was 48.8 years with a 4: 1 male predominance. The prevalence of smokers (80%) and occupational exposure to various inhaled dusts (39%) was high. The clinical, roentgenographic and functional features were in keeping with previous series. Worsening dyspnea was the most common symptom. Other common manifestations were dry cough, recurrent lung infections, weight loss, finger clubbing, crackles and cyanosis. LDH serum levels were increased in 51% of cases. Lung function tests usually showed a mild restrictive ventilatory defect with hypoxemia and reduced DLCO. Chest X ray revealed bilateral ground glass opacities with consolidation or air bronchogram involving peri-hilar or lower lobes. Chest CT scan, performed in 38 patients, revealed a similar pattern in most of them with diffuse intra-alveolar ground glass opacities (33/38) and interlobular thickening (35/38), resulting in a crazy paving appearance in the typical geographic pattern (32/38). This latter aspect was highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Segmental BAL led to a definitive diagnosis in 62% and lung biopsy was only required in 38% of cases. These data suggest that careful BAL analysis can be sufficient to provide a diagnosis without the need for a lung biopsy. During follow-up, spontaneous remission or improvement was reported in 26%. Segmental (n=3) or whole lung lavage (n=22) was required in 62.5% with a favorable course (complete remission 37%, improvement 34%, stable course 21%) in 92% of the cases. In this series the overall prognosis for PAP remained good, although unpredictable.},

This is lower than both the previously published 55\% figure, derived from UK mesothelioma register data 1986-1991, which is based on any mention of mesothelioma on death certificates, cross-referenced to cancer registry data, and the 44\% figure derived from Scottish mortality data 1981-1999, which captured any mention of mesothelioma on the death certificate. Detection from cancer registry data increased to 75\% under ICD-10 in Scotland, confirming earlier predictions of the benefit of ICD-10's more specific mesothelioma codes. Including the accidental poisoning codes E866.4 (ICD-9) and X49 (ICD-10), covering poisoning by 'unspecified' and 'other' causes, which appear to have been used as coding surrogates for mesothelioma when asbestos exposure was explicitly mentioned in deaths suggestive of a mesothelioma, and which are recorded as the underlying cause of death in 4-7\% of mesotheliomas, may improve the mesothelioma detection rate in future epidemiological studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Total pulmonary nonasbestos mineral content was determined for a series of 20 patients who had no occupational dust exposure. To extract mineral fibers, lung tissue was dissolved in bleach and the treated sediment transferred to the electron microscope grid. Mineral fibers were identified using electron diffraction and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The mean number of nonasbestos fibers, 106 X 10(3)/g wet lung, was almost identical to the mean number of asbestos fibers, 102 X 10(3)/g. Thirteen different species or groups of nonasbestos minerals were found: apatite accounted for 18\% of the total and talc for 16\%. All other forms accounted for less than 8\% each. Silica was found in every lung, and talc in 19 of 20 lungs. Of the fibers, 86\% were shorter than 5 microns, and most of the fibers had aspect ratios less than 15. No correlations were seen between numbers or types of fibers and age, sex, or smoking. It is concluded that (1) substantial numbers of nonasbestos fibers are present in lungs of the general population. Most of these fibers are short and of low aspect ratio; and (2) by phase microscopy one is as likely to observe nonasbestos as asbestos fibers in these preparations, indicating that light microscopic methods are not suitable for this type of analysis. These data provide a baseline for comparison with patients believed to have a mineral fiber-related disease.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Objective-To assess whether the increased risk of disease related to asbestos in occupations from the con- struction and engineering industries applies equally to pleural cancer, peri- toneal cancer, and asbestosis. Methods-Analysis was based on deaths among men aged 20-74 in England and Wales during 1979-80 and 1982-90. (n = 1 656 096). Information about cause of death and the last full time occupation of decedents was derived from death certifi- cates. Proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) by occupation were calculated for each of pleural cancer, peritoneal cancer, and asbestosis. Results-Altogether, 2848 deaths were attributed to cancer of the pleura, 362 to cancer of the peritoneum, and 281 to asbestosis. When occupations were ranked according to PMRs from these diseases, striking differences were found. The category of construction workers which included laggers had the highest mortality from peritoneal cancer (PMR 990, 64 deaths), but a PMR of only 160 (77 deaths) for pleural cancer. In contrast, several occupations with much higher mortality from pleural tumours had no excess of peritoneal cancer. PMRs for asbestosis related more closely to those for peritoneal than pleural cancer. Conclusions-These findings suggest that the exposure-response relations for dis- eases related to asbestos are not all linear, and that risks of pleural mesothelioma may be underestimated by simple extrap- olation from observations in cohorts with heavy exposure.},
  comment   = {PMR = The proportion of deaths due to the disease of interest in the exposed population divided by the proportion of deaths due to the disease of interest in the unexposed or reference population. It is frequently converted to a percent by multiplying the ratio by 100. (PMRs) for cancer of the pleura (ICD-9 = 163), cancer of the peri- toneum (ICD-9 = 158-8 and 158-9), and asbestosis (ICD-9 = 501), PMRs for asbestosis related more closely to those for peritoneal than pleural cancer exposure-response relations for mesothelioma and asbestosis are non-linear, with the risk of pleural mesothelioma increasing relatively more steeply at low exposures but less steeply at high exposures* the risks of pleural mesothelioma may be underestimated if a linear exposure-response is assumed. This should be taken into account when control limits are reviewed.},

The relationships derived from the initial comparison were tested in a separate group of biopsy-proved UIP (n = 30) and NSIP (n = 23) cases. Two observers independently scored thin-section CT images for extent, distribution, and coarseness of fibrosis; proportion of ground-glass opacification; severity of traction bronchiectasis; and extent of emphysema.After controlling for extent of fibrosis, patients with asbestosis had coarser fibrosis than those with IPF (odds ratio, 1.52; 95\% CI: 1.25, 1.84; P <.001). Compared with the biopsy-proved cases, the asbestosis cases involved coarser fibrosis (after controlling for disease extent) than the NSIP cases (odds ratio, 2.48; 95\% CI: 1.49, 4.11; P <.001) but fibrosis similar to that in the UIP cases. A basal and subpleural distribution of disease was usual in all subgroups but significantly more prevalent (P, <.01 to.001) with asbestosis than with UIP or NSIP.The thin-section CT pattern of asbestosis closely resembles that of biopsy-proved UIP and differs markedly from that of biopsy-proved NSIP.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study reviews recent data concerning the assessment of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) pulmonary biomarkers in the field of occupational medicine.EBC is a suitable matrix to assess respiratory health status in workers exposed to pneumotoxic substances, due to its ability to quantify lung tissue dose and consequent pulmonary effects. Published data show that toxic metals and trace elements are detectable in EBC, raising the possibility of using this medium to quantify the lung tissue dose of metals occurring in occupational settings. EBC analysis of biomarkers of exposure highlighted the potential use of EBC as completion of the biological monitoring of pneumotoxic compounds. Different biomarkers of effect, such as oxidative stress and inflammatory-derived biomarkers have been applied in the investigation of occupational asthma and pneumoconiosis, suggesting that the collection of EBC may contribute to studying the pathological state of the airways of workers with acute and chronic exposure to pollutants. EBC measurements also seem to be reliable to detect the presence of carcinogenic processes in the respiratory system, by the analysis of various markers of oxidative stress, angiogenesis and DNA alterations related to lung cancer. This approach may open new frontiers in the study of workers currently or previously exposed to pulmonary carcinogenic agents.The analysis of EBC is one of the most promising methods currently available for the study of pulmonary biomarkers of exposure, effect and susceptibility in occupational settings; being collected in a totally noninvasive way, it is particularly suitable to be applied in field studies and for longitudinal assessments of pulmonary biology.},

  Abstract                 = {The etiology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains poorly understood, but some studies have suggested that cigarette smoking or other occupational or environmental exposures, diabetes mellitus, or gastroesophageal reflux may play a role. In this study we evaluated the clinical records of a group of 97 consecutive patients with IPF, and 560 patients suffering 5 different respiratory disorders that were examined as controls: asthma (n=111), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=132), squamous cell lung carcinoma (n=118), lung adenocarcinoma (n=101) and patients with otorhinolaryngology problems but without lung disease (n=98). In bivariate analyses male sex, diabetes mellitus and being former cigarette smoker were associated with IPF. After adjusting by these variables, multivariate analysis revealed that type 2 diabetes mellitus [11.3\% in IPF patients vs 2.9\% in controls, OR=4.3 (95\% CI: 1.9-9.8), p<0.0001] was an independent risk factor associated to IPF. Our results provide additional evidence of a putative relationship between DM2 and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Experimental research is necessary for thorough assessment of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in this association.},

We confirmed association with TERT at 5p15, MUC5B at 11p15 and the 3q26 region near TERC, and we identified seven newly associated loci (Pmeta = 2.4 × 10(-8) to 1.1 × 10(-19)), including FAM13A (4q22), DSP (6p24), OBFC1 (10q24), ATP11A (13q34), DPP9 (19p13) and chromosomal regions 7q22 and 15q14-15. Our results suggest that genes involved in host defense, cell-cell adhesion and DNA repair contribute to risk of fibrotic IIPs.},

Evidence suggests that certain environmental factors, such as cigarette smoking and metal dust exposures, or comorbidities like gastroesophageal reflux, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) may increase risk to develop IPF. Substantial uncertainty remains, however, regarding these and other putative risk factors for IPF. In this study we performed a case-control analysis including 100 patients with IPF and 263 controls matched for age sex and place of residence. We used a structured questionnaire to identify potential risk factors for IPF, including environmental and occupational exposures as well as the relevance of family history of pulmonary fibrosis. The multivariate analysis revealed that family history of pulmonary fibrosis [OR = 6.1, CI95% 2.3-15.9; p < 0.0001] was strongly associated with increased risk of IPF. Actually, 20% of the cases reported a parent or sibling with pulmonary fibrosis. Gastroesophageal reflux [OR = 2.9, CI: 1.3-6.6; p = 0.007], former cigarette smoking [OR = 2.5, CI: 1.4-4.6, p = 0.003], and past or current occupational exposure to dusts, smokes, gases or chemicals [OR = 2.8, CI: 1.5-5.5; p = 0.002] were also associated with the disease. Despite being a significant risk factor on univariate analysis DM2 was not significant in multivariate analysis. These findings indicate that family history of pulmonary fibrosis is a strong risk factor for IPF. Also, we confirmed that occupational exposures, gastroesophageal reflux and former smoking increase the risk for this disease.},

These animals share man's domicile environment, yet do not indulge in activities (e.g., smoking, working) which confound interpretation of epidemiologic studies. Eighteen histologically confirmed canine mesotheliomas were diagnosed at the Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, from April 1977 to December 1981. Sixteen owners of cases and 32 owners of age, breed, and sex-matched controls were interviewed to determine their occupation and medical history and their dog's medical history, life style, diet, and exposure to asbestos. An asbestos-related occupation or hobby of a household member and use of flea repellents on the dog were significantly associated with mesothelioma. In addition, there was a trend indicating an increased risk of mesothelioma with an urban residence. Lung tissue from three dogs with mesothelioma and one dog with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung had higher levels of chrysotile asbestos fibers than lung tissue from control dogs. These findings indicate that well-designed epidemiological studies of spontaneous tumors in pet animals may provide insight into the role of environmental factors in human cancers and serve as a valuable sentinel model to identify environmental health hazards for humans.},

The purpose of this review is to describe coal mining processes and associated exposures to inform the diagnostic evaluation of miners with respiratory symptoms. Although rates of coal workers' pneumoconiosis declined after regulations were enacted in the 1970s, more recent data shows a reversal in this downward trend. Rapidly progressive pneumoconiosis with progressive massive fibrosis (complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis) is being observed with increased frequency in United States coal miners, with histologic findings of silicosis and mixed-dust pneumoconiosis. There is increasing evidence of decline in lung function in individuals with pneumoconiosis. Multiple recent cohort studies suggest increased risk of lung cancer in coal miners. A detailed understanding of coal mining methods and processes allows clinicians to better evaluate and confirm chronic lung diseases caused by inhalational hazards in the mine atmosphere.},

Fly ash, the particulate material produced during coal combustion, has not previously been reported to be present in human lung tissue.

Controls can be taken from known or unknown study populations. A known group consists of a defined population observed over a period, such as passengers on a cruise ship. When the study group is known, a sample of the population can be used as controls. If no population roster exists, then techniques such as random-digit dialling can be used. Sometimes, however, the study group is unknown, for example, motor-vehicle crash victims brought to an emergency department, who may come from far away. In this situation, hospital controls, neighbourhood controls, and friend, associate, or relative controls can be used. In general, one well-selected control group is better than two or more. When the number of cases is small, the ratio of controls to cases can be raised to improve the ability to find important differences. Although no ideal control group exists, readers need to think carefully about how representative the controls are. Poor choice of controls can lead to both wrong results and possible medical harm.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent epidemiologic investigations suggest that occupational and environmental exposures contribute to the overall burden of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This article explores the epidemiologic and clinical challenges to establishing exposure associations, the current literature regarding exposure disease relationships and the diagnostic work-up of IPF and asbestosis patients. IPF patients demonstrate a histopathologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia. In the absence of a known cause or association, a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern leads to an IPF diagnosis, which is a progressive and often terminal fibrotic lung disease. It has long been recognized that asbestos exposure can cause pathologic and radiographic changes indistinguishable from IPF. Several epidemiologic studies, primarily case control in design, have found that a number of other exposures that can increase risk of developing IPF include cigarette smoke, wood dust, metal dust, sand/silica and agricultural exposures. Lung mineralogic analyses have provided additional support to causal associations. Genetic variation may explain differences in disease susceptibility among the population. An accumulating body of literature suggests that occupational and environmental exposure can contribute to the development of IPF. The impact of exposure on the pathogenesis and clinical course of disease requires further study.},

  abstract    = {The etiology of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA) remains largely obscure, although a 1996 report suggested an increased risk from occupational exposure to metal and wood dusts. Using data from death certificates in England and Wales, we sought evidence of any relationship between occupation and CFA and of the extent of any temporospatial clustering of place of birth and place of death as possible evidence of a geographically related environmental factor.Data on occupation and address (postal code) were obtained from certificates of men and women dying as a result of CFA between 1981 and 1990 and were compared with national mortality statistics. Place of birth data were extracted from certificates for deaths between 1993 and 1995, the only available years, and were compared with national birth statistics.Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were raised (p<0.05) in the following four occupational groups: members of the armed forces (SMR, 217.8); miners and quarrymen (SMR, 142.0); service, sports, and recreation workers (SMR, 118.6); and electrical and electronic workers (SMR, 146.6). Of these four groups, the latter group might be worth testing in a future study. There was statistical evidence of geographic clustering in postal code sectors for the recorded place of death, but the high-rate areas were different in men and women. Deaths were increased for those subjects born in urban areas, although these did not follow a clear geographic pattern.Overall, these analyses provide little evidence of any important contribution from environmental factors to the etiology of CFA and suggest that more consideration be given to alternative concepts of causation.},

The patients with DIF were significantly older and had longer occupational histories as compared with those without DIF. There was no correlation between the occurrence of DIF and the type of the underlying disease (silicosis or mixed dust pneumoconiosis) except that an extensive DIF was more frequently associated with mixed dust pneumoconiosis.

Because PAP is rare, prior reports were based on limited patient numbers or a synthesis of historical data. To describe the epidemiologic, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory features of autoimmune PAP in a large, contemporaneous cohort of patients with PAP. Over 6 years, 248 patients with PAP were enrolled in a Japanese national registry, including 223 with autoimmune PAP. Autoimmune PAP represented 89.9% of cases and had a minimum incidence and prevalence of 0.49 and 6.2 per million, respectively. The male to female ratio was 2.1:1, and the median age at diagnosis was 51 years. A history of smoking occurred in 56%, and dust exposure occurred in 23%; instances of familial onset did not occur. Dyspnea was the most common presenting symptom, occurring in 54.3%. Importantly, 31.8% of patients were asymptomatic and were identified by health screening. Intercurrent illnesses, including infections, were infrequent. A disease severity score reflecting the presence of symptoms and degree of hypoxemia correlated well with carbon monoxide diffusing capacity and serum biomarkers, less well with pulmonary function, and not with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibody levels or duration of disease. Autoimmune PAP had an incidence and prevalence higher than previously reported and was not strongly linked to smoking, occupational exposure, or other illnesses. The disease severity score and biomarkers provide novel and potentially useful outcome measures in PAP.},

  abstract    = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) risk-related factors were epidemiologically investigated on the basis of 1,311 Japanese IPF autopsy cases selected from the annual complications of autopsy data records in Japan during a 12-yr period. Age and sex distribution of the subjects revealed a high peak in their seventh decade with males predominating. The IPF rate was more than two times higher (p < 0.01) among subjects engaged in occupations that exposed them to dust or organic solvents compared with those in other jobs. To ascertain job characteristics, an autopsy-case control study was conducted using other annual volumes of the autopsy data records and a similar tendency was observed. Then, a live-case control study was undertaken of 86 subjects with IPF. A significantly higher odds ratio was noted among metal production workers and miners compared with healthy and hospital control subjects (1.37 and 1.34, respectively, p < 0.01), and also a significantly lower odds ratio among subjects who frequently eat fish. Taken together with results of recent in vitro studies, the intrapulmonary deposition of hazardous dusts, especially metallic dusts, appears to play at least a partial role in initiating IPF.},

  Abstract                 = {This study shows that energy dispersive x-ray microprobe analysis to identify and quantify intracellular particles in macrophages obtained by the minimally invasive method of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can detect inorganic dust exposures of many different kinds. Bronchoalveolar lavage macrophages from 22 patients have been examined. Twelve patients had occupational exposure to asbestos, talc, silica, hard metal or printing ink, while 10 had no known history of dust exposure. X-ray microprobe analysis identified particles which related to the known exposures, superimposed on a background of other particles related to smoking (kaolinite and mica) or to the general environment (silicon, titanium, and iron). The particle identification provided useful objective confirmation of the known exposures, except for silica, which could not be distinguished from the general background levels. X-ray microanalysis using BAL macrophages can be helpful for clarification of mixed dust exposures, to identify particles when light microscopy indicates retained dust in patients with no known history of exposure, and to monitor retained particles after removal from exposure.},

In 1984 the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys changed the rules on coding according to rule 3 of the World Health Organisation, so that if the cause of death was recorded as, for example, unspecified pneumonia or broncho- pneumonia in part 1 of the death certificate the disease mentioned in part 2 became the underlying cause of death. Duplicate coding of all deaths ascribed to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis in 1984 according to the new and old rules showed a 6% increase in deaths ascribed to the disease under the new rule. Consequently the number of deaths from 1984 onwards should be scaled down by a factor of 0-94 so that the two periods are comparable. explores why mort rate increasing. more diagnosis? cf rcp map :-)x`},

  Abstract                 = {The last century experienced remarkable advances in the classification, diagnosis, and understanding of the pathogenesis of the interstitial lung diseases. Technological advances, particularly physiologic testing, lung imaging studies, bronchoalveolar lavage, surgical lung biopsy, and histopathologic assessment, improved our understanding of these entities. In particular, the advent of high-resolution computed tomography, the narrowed pathologic definition of usual interstitial pneumonia, and recognition of the prognostic importance of separating usual interstitial pneumonia from other idiopathic interstitial pneumonia patterns have profoundly changed the approach to these processes. Most recently, genetic medicine, the use of new technologies (e.g., microarrays, mass spectroscopic analysis of proteins, and laser capture microdissection), and the development of animal models have had a major impact on understanding the pathogenesis and potential molecular targets for interfering with fibrogenesis. This article highlights some of the advances and changes in clinical practice that took place in the management of patients with interstitial lung diseases over the last century.},

  Abstract                 = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating, age-related lung disease of unknown cause that has few treatment options. This disease was once thought to be a chronic inflammatory process, but current evidence indicates that the fibrotic response is driven by abnormally activated alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). These cells produce mediators that induce the formation of fibroblast and myofibroblast foci through the proliferation of resident mesenchymal cells, attraction of circulating fibrocytes, and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The fibroblast and myofibroblast foci secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix, mainly collagens, resulting in scarring and destruction of the lung architecture. The mechanisms that link idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with ageing and aberrant epithelial activation are unknown; evidence suggests that the abnormal recapitulation of developmental pathways and epigenetic changes have a role. In this Seminar, we review recent data on the clinical course, therapeutic options, and underlying mechanisms thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

IPF cases and controls were matched in terms of age group, sex and place of residence. Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed. In simple logistic regression analysis, exposure to metal dust and any exposure for >1 year in an occupational setting were significantly associated with IPF (metal dust OR 4.00, 95%CI 1.34-11.97; any exposure OR 3.67, 95%CI 1.02-13.14). After adjustment for environmental and military exposures and smoking history, the OR for metal dust exposure was 4.97 (95%CI 1.36-18.17) in multiple logistic regression analysis.

  Abstract                 = {The molecular pathomechanisms underlying idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are elusive, but chronic epithelial injury has recently been suggested as key event.We investigated the possible implication of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis in sporadic IPF.We analyzed peripheral explanted lung tissues from patients with sporadic IPF (n = 24), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 9), and organ donors (n = 12) for expression of major ER stress mediators and apoptosis markers by means of immunoblotting, semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and the TUNEL method.Compared with COPD and donor lungs, protein levels of ER stress mediators, such as processed p50 activating transcription factor (ATF)-6 and ATF-4 and the apoptosis-inductor CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein), as well as transcript levels of spliced X-box binding protein (XBP)-1, were significantly elevated in lung homogenates and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs) of IPF lungs. Proapoptotic, oligomeric forms of Bax, which play a key role in ER stress-mediated apoptosis downstream of CHOP induction, as well as caspase-3 cleavage, could be detected in IPF lungs. By means of immunohistochemistry, exclusive induction of active ATF-6, ATF-4, and CHOP in AECIIs was encountered in IPF but not in COPD or donor lungs. Immunoreactivity was most prominent in the epithelium near dense zones of fibrosis and fibroblast foci, where these ER stress markers colocalized with markers of apoptosis (TUNEL, cleaved caspase-3).Severe ER stress response in the AECIIs of patients with sporadic IPF may underlie the apoptosis of this cell type and development of fibrosis in this disease.},

  Abstract                 = {In epidemiological questionnaire studies results can be influenced by non-responder bias. However, in respiratory epidemiology this has been analysed in very few recently published papers. The aim of our paper is to assess if the results found in our previous postal questionnaire study in an adult population in Northern Finland were biased by non-response.A random sample of 385 persons from the 1,284 non-responders in a previous postal questionnaire study was examined. The same questionnaire as in the original study was again mailed to these persons, and those still not answering were contacted by phone.Totally 183 complete answers (48\%) were collected. Lack of interest (56\%) and forgetting to mail the response letter (22\%) were the most common reasons to non-response. Typical non-responders were young men and current smokers who less frequently reported respiratory symptoms in exercise and asthma than the responders in the original study. Answers collected by phone gave for some questions higher prevalence rates than postal answers.Firstly, in this population the response rate (83.6\%) in the original study was high enough to provide reliable results for respiratory symptoms and diseases, only the prevalence of current smoking was biased by non-response. Secondly, the methods used for collecting responses in a non-response study may influence the results.},

  Abstract                 = {To assess how early pleural and/or parenchymal abnormalities consistent with asbestos exposure could be ascertained and to identify factors associated with progression.Informed consent was obtained under an institutional review board-approved protocol. Multiple sequential chest radiographs obtained between 1955 and 2004 in 84 workers exposed to amphiboles associated with vermiculite in the town of Libby, Montana, were studied. A panel of three NIOSH B readers reviewed each worker's longitudinal chest radiograph series in reverse chronologic order and achieved a consensus reading for each radiograph. Measures of exposure were compared between workers with and those without progression of parenchymal and pleural abnormalities.Because of the way the study was designed, all subjects had pleural (n = 84) and/or parenchymal (n = 26) abnormalities on the most recent chest radiograph. Compared with other investigations that used different methods, this investigation revealed shorter latency periods (defined as the interval between date of hire and date of earliest radiographic detection) for circumscribed pleural plaque (median latency, 8.6 years) and pleural calcification (median latency, 17.5 years). Pleural abnormalities progressed in 64 workers, while parenchymal abnormalities progressed in 14. No significant differences were found with regard to measures of exposure between workers with and those without progression.The latency period for the development of pleural plaques may be shorter than previously reported. Early plaques are subtle and may not be detectable except at retrospective review.},

  Abstract                 = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrotic lung disease of unknown cause characterized by relentlessly progressive restrictive-ventilatory limitation, hypoxia, dyspnea, and cough. Both the incidence and prevalence of IPF appears to be increasing, with little impact on its dismal 3-year median survival, despite two decades of clinical trials. Increasingly recognized are the serious associated comorbid illnesses, including pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, lung cancer, and depression that further contribute to the substantial rise in the use of IPF-related healthcare resources. At present, lung transplantation remains the sole viable treatment for the few who qualify. Pharmacologic interventions targeting lung function and survival have remained largely disappointing, and very few investigations have specifically targeted comorbid conditions, symptoms, quality-of-life, and healthcare resource utilization. In reviewing the burden of illness associated with IPF, including the epidemiology, comorbidities, quality-of-life and the physical, psychosocial, and economic costs of this devastating disease, we hope to highlight some of the unmet medical needs associated with IPF, and encourage both public support and further investigations into these and other patient-centered outcomes and not just that of survival and lung function.},

  Abstract                 = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease of unknown cause that conveys a dismal prognosis. In the United States there are currently no licensed therapies for treatment of IPF. The development of effective IPF clinical trials networks across the United States and Europe, however, has led to key developments in the treatment of IPF. Advances in understanding of the pathogenetic processes involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis have led to novel therapeutic targets. These developments offer hope that there may, in the near future, be therapeutic options available for treatment of this devastating disease.},

However, 23\% of patients required hospitalization for a respiratory disorder and 21\% died. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was the primary cause of death in 89\% of patients who died, and an apparent acute clinical deterioration preceded death in 47\% of these patients.The instrument used to define the pace of deterioration and cause of death was applied retrospectively.Recognition of the common occurrence of acute fatal deterioration in patients with mild to moderate IPF has important implications for monitoring patients and supports early referral for lung transplantation.},

Temporal trends in SMRs were also examined. Proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were calculated using the Southampton (based on the 1980 standard occupational classification) coding scheme. Temporal trends in PMRs were also examined.The annual number of mesothelioma deaths has increased from 153 in 1968 to 1848 in 2001. Current deaths in males account for about 85\% of the cases. The areas of West Dunbartonshire (SMR 637), Barrow-in-Furness (593), Plymouth (396) and Portsmouth (388) have the highest SMRs over the period 1981-2000. The occupations with the highest PMRs are metal plate workers (PMR 503), vehicle body builders (526), plumbers and gas fitters (413) and carpenters (388).These data reinforce earlier findings that geographical areas and occupations associated with high exposure to asbestos in the past continue to drive the mesothelioma epidemic in Great Britain. However, the trends over time suggest a change in the balance of risk away from traditional asbestos exposure industries to industries where one could describe the exposure as secondary, such as plumbers and gas fitters, carpenters, and electricians.},

The Si/S ratio for 25 samples of normal lung and 6 samples of pneumoconiotic lung was also determined (upper limit of normal Si/S ratio = 0.3). The difference between the Si/S ratio in the group with IPF and group with normal lung tissue was significantly significant (p less than .007, Wilcoxon test). Six of 12 patients with a previous diagnosis of IPF and a Si/S ratio greater than 0.3 had an exposure history that could imply inhalation of silica/silicates, and the correct diagnosis for these patients is most probably pneumoconiosis. The silica/silicate deposits detected in patients with IPF, and who had a ratio and no past exposure to dusts, could be either a cause or an effect of the disease.},

  Abstract                 = {The clinical features of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis can be indistinguishable; the need to eliminate occult environmental factors known to cause pulmonary fibrosis in patients suspected to have IPF during diagnostic evaluation is evident. We aimed to investigate occult, putative causes in the environments of patients diagnosed with IPF using tests beyond those conventionally used.In this case-cohort study, 60 consecutive patients diagnosed with IPF on the basis of the 2000 American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria were prospectively followed up every 4 months for 6 years between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2009. At each visit a uniformly applied questionnaire was administered to these 60 patients to identify occult antigen exposure known to cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Patients underwent specific IgG determination, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial challenge testing with suspected antigens, and re-review of histopathological features in existing and subsequently obtained surgical lung biopsy samples and from lung explants. Specimens obtained from suspected sources from the patient's environment were subjected to cultures in microbiology laboratory. These clinical data and discussions among pulmonologists and radiologists familiar with IPF were used to confirm the diagnosis in accordance with 2011 ATS, ERS, Japanese Respiratory Society, and Latin American Thoracic Association guidelines; 46 of the 60 patients had IPF according to the 2011 guidelines, and our analyses in this study were focused on these 46 patients.20 of the 46 (43\%, 95\% CI 29-58) patients with IPF according to 2011 guidelines had a subsequent diagnosis of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis: nine patients had positive bronchial challenge testing (eight of whom were also IgG positive and six of these patients also had surgical lung biopsy showing a pattern consistent with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis); seven were IgG positive plus had histopathology on surgical lung biopsy that was consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis; one was IgG positive plus had greater than 20\% lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; and three had findings on surgical lung biopsy that were consistent with subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis (and IgG positive). Altogether, 29 of 46 patients diagnosed with IPF who had met the 2011 criteria had lung tissue available for histopathology (surgical lung biopsy in 28 patients and explanted lung in two patients, one of whom also had surgical biopsy) during the study period, and 16 of the 20 patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis had histopathological features on surgical lung biopsy that were consistent with this diagnosis. 26 of the 46 patients remained with a diagnosis of IPF.Almost half of patients diagnosed with IPF on the basis of 2011 criteria were subsequently diagnosed with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and most of these cases were attributed to exposure of occult avian antigens from commonly used feather bedding. Our results reflect findings in one centre with recognised expertise in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and further research and studies at other centres are warranted.Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias; Fundació Privada Cellex; SEPAR 2010.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors conducted a matched case-control study of interstitial lung disease (ILD) using a self-administered questionnaire. All cases in the practice of two pulmonary specialists were identified. Cases were excluded if they were thought to have occupational exposures as a contributor, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or sarcoidosis, or some other well-recognized cause. Three controls were matched by sex and age (one year) as identified through orthopedic surgeons at the same institutions. Two rounds of a questionnaire were mailed; 17 cases (37.7\%) and 94 controls (32.4\%) responded to the questionnaire, although many of the case addresses were no longer valid. Individuals with ILD were 16.0 times as likely to report mold exposure and 11.1 times as likely to report silica as were controls in their workplace. Odds ratios associating ILD with moisture indicators in the home were in the same range as previously published associations between such indicators and wheezing. ILD may have environmental and occupational causes that warrant more systematic exploration.},

For these analyses, the data on registered deaths and the general population were grouped into 5 year age bands over the age of 55 years and calendar periods were grouped into 5 year periods, but without combining years with different ICD codes. We calculated age- and sex stratum-specific mortality rates for each year and then applied these rates to the 2008 population to generate annual standardised mortality numbers. Poisson regression modelling was used to estimate annual mortality rate ratios with adjustment for sex and age. 2. Using THIN data: We calculated crude annual incidence rates, stratified by sex and age in 5 year age bands over the age of 55 years. Poisson regression modelling was applied to estimate annual incidence rate ratios, controlling for age, sex and health authority. 3. Survival analysis, individuals with IPF-CS were assigned a start date that was defined as the date of diagnosis and a stop date that was defined as the earliest of either the last THIN data collection or the date of death. In order to determine if mortality was changing over time, we calculated the median survival for this cohort overall and survival stratified by 2 year calendar periods using KaplaneMeir methods. Cox regression was used to compare mortality rates between the different age groups, sex and calendar periods. Multiplicative interaction terms were applied to test for interactions between mortality rates in the different calendar periods and age or sex},

  Abstract                 = {Laboratory studies suggest that the clotting cascade is activated in fibrotic lungs. Since humans vary in their tendency to clot due to a variety of inherited or acquired defects, we investigated whether a prothrombotic state increases the chance of developing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and/or worsens the prognosis of IPF.We recruited 211 incident cases of IPF and 256 age- and sex-matched general population controls and collected data on medical history, medication, smoking habit, blood samples as well as lung function and high-resolution CT scans done as part of routine clinical care. A prothrombotic state was defined as the presence of at least one inherited or acquired clotting defect or marker of fibrinolytic dysfunction. We used logistic regression to quantify the association between a prothrombotic state and IPF adjusted for age, sex, smoking habit and highly sensitive C reactive protein. Cox regression was used to determine the influence of a prothrombotic state on survival.Cases were more than four times more likely than controls to have a prothrombotic state (OR 4.78, 95\% CI 2.93 to 7.80; p<0.0001). Cases with a prothrombotic state were also likely to have more severe disease (forced vital capacity <70\% predicted) at presentation (OR 10.79, 95\% CI 2.43 to 47.91) and had a threefold increased risk of death (HR 3.26, 95\% CI 1.09 to 9.75).People with IPF are more likely to have a prothrombotic state than general population controls and the presence of a prothrombotic state has an adverse impact on survival.},

Of these, 3,327 workers have specific smoking status information and 3,312 workers have lung volume measures.Chest radiographs were interpreted by a certified B-reader, and abnormalities were quantified according to the ILO scoring system. Spirometry and lung volume measurement were performed. Subjects completed a self-administered questionnaire that was reviewed at the time of examination. Control subjects were screened on two separate occasions at least 10 years apart to exclude subclinical or slowly progressive asbestos-induced lung disease.The mean age of the population was 65.1 +/- 9.9 years, and the latency was 41.4 +/- 10.1 years (+/- SD). Most subjects (41.8\%) had normal pulmonary function. Obstruction was the most common pulmonary function abnormality (25.4\%), followed by restriction (19.3\%) and a mixed pattern (6.0\%). Most subjects (79.4\%) had low ILO scores. Benign pleural abnormalities were the only findings in 54\% of subjects with low ILO score. Subjects with high ILO scores were older, smoked more, and had a longer latency than subjects with low ILO scores and control subjects. Smokers were younger, had a shorter latency, and had paradoxically greater ILO scores than nonsmokers. Subjects with bronchogenic cancer and mesothelioma had longer latencies than control subjects and subjects with benign asbestos-induced lung disease.Asbestos-induced lung disease today is characterized by low ILO scores, long latencies, greater disease magnitude in smokers, and a normal or obstructive pattern of pulmonary function abnormality. Spirometric evaluation in the absence of lung volume measurements caused misclassification that resulted in overestimation of the presence of a restrictive pattern of pulmonary function.},

The radiographs were classified according to the 1980 International Labor Office (ILO) classification. Progression was accepted if the second or third radiography was estimated (in a side-by-side comparison) to have more profusion of small opacities qualitatively than the first, even if the radiographs were classified into the same profusion category.In all, 38\% of the patients showed progression during the follow-up period. The average progression of small opacities ranged from ILO 1/1 to ILO 2/2 (0.4 minor ILO categories/year). The asbestosis was progressive more often among the sprayers than among the insulators and asbestos factory workers [cross-tabulation, odds ratio (OR) 5.0, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.2-20]. In the logistic regression model the ILO classification category at the beginning of the follow-up (OR 1.54; 95\% CI 0.96-2.47), the fibronectin (OR 1.01; 95\% CI 1.00-1.01) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; OR 1.10; 95\% CI 1.00-1.20) levels, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; OR 1.05; 95\% CI 1.00-1.10) were statistically associated with the radiographic progression of small opacities. Abnormalities of the pleura were found to progress more often among the patients with progressive parenchymal opacities.For the progression of small-opacity profusion the significant predictors in the logistic regression model were the ILO profusion category at the beginning of the follow-up period, the fibronectin level, the ACE value, and the ESR. The model correctly classified 94\% of the patients with progression and 65\% of those without progression. The differences in the mean values recorded for the biomarkers between the progressors and nonprogressors, however, were small and may therefore not be of any importance to the clinician.},

  Abstract                 = {National analyses of mortality in England and Wales have repeatedly shown excess deaths from pneumonia in welders. During 1979-90 the excess was attributable largely to deaths from lobar pneumonia and pneumonias other than bronchopneumonia, limited to men of working age and apparent in other occupations with exposure to metal fumes. The findings for 1991-2000 were assessed and compared with the mortality pattern from asthma in occupations exposed to known respiratory sensitisers.The Office of National Statistics supplied data on deaths by underlying cause among men aged 16-74 years in England and Wales during 1991-2000, including age and last held occupation. Data were abstracted on pneumonia for occupations with exposure to metal fumes and on asthma for occupations commonly reported to surveillance schemes as at risk of occupational asthma. The expected numbers of deaths were estimated by applying age-specific proportions of deaths by cause in the population to the total deaths by age in each occupational group. Observed and expected numbers were compared for each cause of death.Among men of working age in occupations with exposure to metal fumes there was excess mortality from pneumococcal and lobar pneumonia (54 deaths vs 27.3 expected) and from pneumonias other than bronchopneumonia (71 vs 52.4), but no excess from these causes at older ages or from bronchopneumonia at any age. The attributable mortality from metal fume exposure was 45.3 excess deaths compared with an estimated 62.6 deaths from occupational asthma.Exposure to metal fumes is a material cause of occupational mortality. The hazard deserves far more attention than it presently receives.},

  Abstract                 = {To test the hypothesis that inhalation of metal fume reversibly increases susceptibility to pneumonia, the authors conducted a case-control study. Men aged 20-64 years, admitted to 11 hospitals in West Midlands, England, with community-acquired pneumonia during 1996-1999 were interviewed about their lifetime occupational history, exposure to metal fume, and potential confounding factors. Similar information was collected from controls admitted to the same hospitals with nonrespiratory illness. For cases, exposures were timed relative to the onset of their illness (on average, 6 months before interview). Exposure histories for controls were censored 6 months before interview. Interviews were completed by 525 cases and 1,122 controls (response rates of 74\% and 99\%). Pneumonia was associated with reported occupational exposure to metal fume in the previous year (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.6, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 2.4) but not in earlier periods (OR = 1.1). The risk was highest for lobar pneumonia and recent exposure to ferrous fume (OR = 2.3, 95\% CI: 1.2, 4.3). The association was not specific to any one microorganism. These findings support the hypothesis that ferrous and possibly other metal fumes reversibly predispose to infectious pneumonia. Research should now focus on the underlying mechanisms and prevention.},

  Abstract                 = {Metal and wood dust exposures have been identified as possible occupational risk factors for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We analyzed mortality data using ICD-10 code J84.1--"Other interstitial pulmonary diseases with fibrosis," derived age-adjusted mortality rates for 1999-2003, and assessed occupational risks for 1999, by calculating proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) and mortality odds ratios (MORs) using a matched case-control approach. We identified 84,010 IPF deaths, with an age-adjusted mortality rate of 75.7 deaths/million. Mortality rates were highest among males, whites, and those aged 85 and older. Three industry categories with potential occupational exposures recognized as risk factors for IPF were identified: "Wood buildings and mobile homes" (PMR = 4.5, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-11.6 and MOR = 5.3, 95\% CI 1.2-23.8), "Metal mining" (PMR = 2.4, 95\% CI 1.3-4.0 and MOR = 2.2, 95\% CI 1.1-4.4), and "Fabricated structural metal products" (PMR = 1.9, 95\% CI 1.1-3.1 and MOR = 1.7, 95\% CI 1.0-3.1). Workers in these industry categories may benefit from toxicological studies and improved surveillance for this disease.},

Male ORs (95\% confidence interval (CI)) relative to low-risk occupations for >10 years of exposure before the age of 30 years were 50.0 (25.8-96.8) for carpenters (LR 1 in 17), 17.1 (10.3-28.3) for plumbers, electricians and painters, 7.0 (3.2-15.2) for other construction workers, 15.3 (9.0-26.2) for other recognised high-risk occupations and 5.2 (3.1-8.5) in other industries where asbestos may be encountered. The LR was similar in apparently unexposed men and women (approximately 1 in 1000), and this was approximately doubled in exposed workers' relatives (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.3-3.2). No other environmental hazards were identified. In all, 14\% of male and 62\% of female cases were not attributable to occupational or domestic asbestos exposure. Approximately half of the male cases were construction workers, and only four had worked for more than 5 years in asbestos product manufacture.},

  Abstract                 = {Asbestos exposure has resulted in a variety of diseases, including asbestosis, carcinoma of the lung (LC), pleural plaques, and malignant mesothelioma (MM). We hypothesized that there have been significant changes in the mineral fiber content of lung tissue from individuals with these diseases over the past 25 years. Asbestos content was measured in lung tissue samples from 819 individuals using light microscopy (to measure asbestos body concentrations) and scanning electron microscopy (to measure types and concentrations of mineral fibers). Cases were divided chronologically according to those occurring in the first half (group 1) versus those occurring in the second half (group 2). The study included 419 cases of MM, 206 cases of asbestosis, and 340 cases of LC. The median asbestos body count (in asbestos bodies per gram) decreased from group 1 to group 2 for each disease: MM, 480 to 350; asbestosis, 24700 to 19200; and LC, 1600 to 174 (reference range, 0-20). A similar trend was observed for fiber counts by scanning electron microscopy. Amosite was the most frequently detected asbestos fiber type and decreased in frequency of detection and median concentration from group 1 to group 2. Crocidolite showed an increased detection frequency from group 1 to group 2 across all 3 disease categories. The decrease in asbestos body and amosite concentrations over time is consistent with the banning of asbestos from insulation products in 1972. The source for the increased detection of crocidolite was not identified and needs further investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {The initial results of a survey of 588 patients with a clinical presentation of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA) also known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, have been published. This article reports further results pertaining to response to treatment and survival.Data on the treatment given and lung function response were collected over 4-6 years. Survival data were collected over 10 years.Treatment was given to 445 (76\%) patients, 55\% were given prednisolone alone and the remainder another immunosuppressive agent, usually with prednisolone. Treated patients had worse lung function initially. At 3 months after study entry, treated patients were more likely to have improved forced vital capacity (FVC) than the untreated patients. Patients whose FVC improved were younger (p = 0.001 analysis of variance (ANOVA)) and had lower initial FVC (p<0.001, ANOVA). Patients who responded to treatment at 3 months or at 1 year survived longer than those who remained stable, who in turn survived longer than those who deteriorated (p = 0.002). These differences were largely accounted for by patients with better lung function surviving longer. Younger age at entry, female sex and higher percentage predicted FVC and carbon monoxide transfer factor [corrected] at study entry were associated with greater chances of survival at 4 years. Overall median survival from entry was 2.43 years (95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.17 to 3.18).About a third of patients with CFA showed improved lung function after initiation of corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatment, and those who improved survived longer. Poorer lung function, male sex and age are adverse prognostic features. Overall survival was poor.},

  abstract     = {The impact of a broad range of occupational exposures on subclinical interstitial lung disease (ILD) has not been studied. To determine whether occupational exposures to vapors, gas, dust and fumes (VGDF) are associated with high attenuation areas (HAA) and interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), which are quantitative and qualitative CT-based measurements of subclinical ILD, respectively. We performed analyses of participants enrolled in MESA, a population-based cohort age 45-84 at recruitment. HAA was measured at baseline and on serial cardiac CT scans in 5686 participants. ILA was ascertained in a subset of 2312 participants who underwent full lung CT scanning at 10-year follow-up. Occupational exposures were assessed by self-reported VGDF exposure and by job exposure matrix (JEM). Linear mixed models and logistic regression were used to determine whether occupational exposures were associated with log-transformed HAA and ILA. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, employment status, tobacco use, and scanner technology. Each JEM score increment in VGDF exposure was associated with 3.31% greater HAA (95%CI 2.11% to 4.53%). Self-reported fume exposure was associated with 2.38% greater HAA (95%CI 0.44% to 4.36%). Self-reported vapors/gas exposure was associated with an increased odds of ILA among those currently employed (1.76-fold, 95%CI 1.09 to 2.84) and those less than 65 years old (1.97-fold, 95%CI 1.16 to 3.35). There was no consistent evidence that occupational exposures were associated with progression of HAA over the follow-up period. JEM-assigned and self-reported exposures to VGDF were associated with measurements of subclinical ILD in community-dwelling adults.},

We evaluated airway and parenchymal pathology using standardized diagnostic criteria and semiquantitative grading schemata, including the grading of small airways for fibrosis and birefringent mineral dust particles. We analyzed lung dust burden on a subset of 37 lungs following bleach digestion, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray spectrometry (XRS) and image analysis, and by X-ray diffraction for crystalline silica (CSi). Farmworkers comprised 51.5\% and nonfarmworkers 48.5\% of the samples.Proximal airways demonstrated little mineral dust accumulation, but membranous and respiratory bronchioles had wall thickening, remodeling, and inflammation associated with carbonaceous and mineral dust deposition. These changes were independently associated with agricultural work, cigarette smoking, and increased age. Mineral dust small airways disease, pneumoconiosis (macules and nodules), and pathologic changes consistent with chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and interstitial fibrosis predominated in farmworkers compared with nonfarmworkers. CSi, determined gravimetrically, and aluminum silicate particles, determined by SEM/XRS, were increased in the lungs of farmworkers compared with nonfarmworkers and were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with small airway disease and pneumoconiosis.Mineral dust exposure is associated with increased small airway disease and pneumoconiosis among California farmworkers; however, the clinical significance and natural history of these changes remains to be determined.},

  Abstract                 = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a complex, heterogeneous genetic disorder that is associated with rare and common sequence variants in many genes (MUC5B, SFTPC, SFTPA2, RTEL1, TERT, and hTR), 11 novel loci, and multiple emerging epigenetic and transcriptional profiles. In the past 5 years, we have found that: 1) genetic risk variants play major and similar roles in the development of both familial and sporadic fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, accounting for up to 35% of the risk of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (a disease that was previously thought to be idiopathic); 2) a promoter variant in MUC5B rs35705950 is the strongest risk factor for the development of IIP and IPF; however, rs35705950 has a low penetrance; and 3) IPF is a complex genetic disease with 11 independent loci contributing to the development of this disease, pronounced changes in DNA methylation, and transcriptional subtypes. In aggregate, these findings suggest that IPF is a heterogeneous disease and that genetic and molecular subtypes of IPF will provide essential clues to disease pathogenesis, prognosis, treatment, and survival, all of which remain major problems in understanding and treating patients with IPF. Although the basic biological mechanisms involved in IPF are emerging, the disease is heterogeneous pathologically and the final common pathways of fibrogenesis are not well understood. These observations lead us to postulate that the etiology and severity/extent of this complex condition will best be understood through an integrated approach that accounts for inherited factors, epigenetic marks, and dynamic changes in the transcriptome.},

  Abstract                 = {The mutations that have been implicated in pulmonary fibrosis account for only a small proportion of the population risk.Using a genomewide linkage scan, we detected linkage between idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and a 3.4-Mb region of chromosome 11p15 in 82 families. We then evaluated genetic variation in this region in gel-forming mucin genes expressed in the lung among 83 subjects with familial interstitial pneumonia, 492 subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and 322 controls. MUC5B expression was assessed in lung tissue.Linkage and fine mapping were used to identify a region of interest on the p-terminus of chromosome 11 that included gel-forming mucin genes. The minor-allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs35705950, located 3 kb upstream of the MUC5B transcription start site, was present at a frequency of 34\% among subjects with familial interstitial pneumonia, 38\% among subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and 9\% among controls (allelic association with familial interstitial pneumonia, P=1.2×10(-15); allelic association with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, P=2.5×10(-37)). The odds ratios for disease among subjects who were heterozygous and those who were homozygous for the minor allele of this SNP were 6.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 12.0) and 20.8 (95\% CI, 3.8 to 113.7), respectively, for familial interstitial pneumonia and 9.0 (95\% CI, 6.2 to 13.1) and 21.8 (95\% CI, 5.1 to 93.5), respectively, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. MUC5B expression in the lung was 14.1 times as high in subjects who had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as in those who did not (P<0.001). The variant allele of rs35705950 was associated with up-regulation in MUC5B expression in the lung in unaffected subjects (expression was 37.4 times as high as in unaffected subjects homozygous for the wild-type allele, P<0.001). MUC5B protein was expressed in lesions of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.A common polymorphism in the promoter of MUC5B is associated with familial interstitial pneumonia and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Our findings suggest that dysregulated MUC5B expression in the lung may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others.).},

Significant predictors of disease progression were found by a linear stepwise regression analysis from among such variables as smoking history, latency (time since first exposure), duration and intensity of exposure, and cytology.Although most radiographs remained normal, some showed progression of disease with about twice as many patients with abnormalities on the last film. Various combinations of age, intensity of exposure, and time between films were significant predictors of pleural and parenchymal disease and progression of such disease. No predominance of one sided disease was noted. Cytology and smoking were unreliable predictors of disease. Most disease progression was minor, usually of less than two scoring categories.An intense, yet short, exposure to amosite asbestos can produce pleural and parenchymal changes on chest radiographs. The number of those affected roughly doubled over a period spanning 10 to 20 years after exposure. Age and intensity of exposure are the most important predictors of disease.},

This article presents three cases of typical and two cases of atypical silicosis with rounded atelectasis as seen in computed radiographic (CR), computed tomographic (CT), and scintigraphic images and autopsied lung specimens. Chest radiographs revealed both small rounded and small irregular opacities. Small irregular opacities on chest radiographs often proved to be reticular or honeycomb patterns on CT scans. Irregular opacities seen on CR and CT images represented interstitial fibrotic or mixed dust fibrotic changes associated with the accumulation of birefringent particles and emphysematous change, as noted at histologic analysis. CT scans and scintigrams were useful for visualizing parenchymal abnormalities, especially fibrotic change, emphysematous change, and pleural abnormalities.},

Survivors were offered a follow-up evaluation.Morbidity and mortality related to AEP.There were 18 cases of AEP identified among 183,000 military personnel deployed in or near Iraq during the study period, yielding an AEP incidence of 9.1 per 100,000 person-years (95\% confidence interval, 4.3-13.3). The majority of patients (89\%) were men and the median age was 22 (range, 19-47) years. All patients used tobacco, with 78\% recently beginning to smoke. All but 1 reported significant exposure to fine airborne sand or dust. Known causes of pulmonary eosinophilia (eg, drug exposures or parasitic disease) were not identified. Epidemiologic investigation revealed no evidence of a common source exposure, temporal or geographic clustering, person-to-person transmission, or an association with recent vaccination. Six patients underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (median eosinophilia of 40.5\%). All patients developed peripheral eosinophilia (range, 8\%-42\%). Mechanical ventilation was required in 67\% for a median of 7 (range, 2-16) days. Two soldiers died; the remainder responded to corticosteroids and/or supportive care. Twelve individuals were reevaluated a median of 3 months after diagnosis. At that point, 3 patients reported mild dyspnea and 1 reported wheezing. All patients had finished treatment and had either normal or nearly normal spirometry results. None had recurrent eosinophilia.AEP occurred at an increased rate among this deployed military population and resulted in 2 deaths. Failure to consider AEP in the differential diagnosis of respiratory failure in military personnel can result in missing this syndrome and possibly death. The etiology of AEP remains unclear, but the association with new-onset smoking suggests a possible link.},

There was HIPAA compliance for all U.S. patients. The study included 66 patients (36 men, 30 women; mean age, 58.8 years +/- 10.9 [standard deviation]) with proved chronic HP (n = 18), IPF (n = 23), or NSIP (n = 25) who underwent CT. Two independent readers assessed the CT images, made a first-choice diagnosis, and noted the degree of confidence in the diagnosis. A general linear model was used to identify CT features that independently differentiated chronic HP from IPF and NSIP. Weighted kappa statistic was used to assess interobserver agreement.The CT features that best differentiated chronic HP were lobular areas with decreased attenuation and vascularity, centrilobular nodules, and absence of lower zone predominance of abnormalities (P < or = .008). The features that best differentiated NSIP were relative subpleural sparing, absence of lobular areas with decreased attenuation, and lack of honeycombing (P < or = .002). The features that best differentiated IPF were basal predominance of honeycombing, absence of relative subpleural sparing, and absence centrilobular nodules (P < or = .004). A confident diagnosis was made in 70 (53\%) of 132 readings. This diagnosis was correct in 66 (94\%) of 70 readings. The accuracy for the entire cohort was 80\%. Interobserver agreement for confident diagnosis was good to excellent (kappa = 0.77-0.96).Characteristic CT features of chronic HP, IPF, and NSIP allow confident distinction between these entities in approximately 50\% of patients.},

The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 107,000 people worldwide die each year from mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis. We review what is known about asbestos use, production, and exposure and asbestos-related diseases in the world today, and we offer predictions for the future. Although worldwide consumption of asbestos has decreased, consumption is increasing in many developing countries. The limited data available suggest that exposures may also be high in developing countries. Mesothelioma is still increasing in most European countries and in Japan but has peaked in the United States and Sweden. Although the epidemic of asbestos-related disease has plateaued or is expected to plateau in most of the developed world, little is known about the epidemic in developing countries. It is obvious that increased asbestos use by these countries will result in an increase in asbestos-related diseases in the future.},

The patients' ages ranged from 45 to 74 years at the time of study. None of the patients had asbestosis. The distribution of fibres and dust content of the lungs showed a log-normal distribution. There was no significant difference in fibre counts or dust content between men and women, and between lung cancer and non-cancer patients. The only group with an association with a high asbestos fibre count was four necropsy cases of pleural mesothelioma. There was no significant relationship between asbestos fibre count and dust content of the lung. The present data suggest that asbestos fibre counts below 100,000 per gram of dried lung are not related to specific asbestos disease, although in the surgical cases who were closely questioned on their residential and occupational histories most of those with fibre counts above 30,000 per gram dried lung had had occasions of definite or very likely asbestos exposure.},

  Abstract                 = {Of the idiopathic lung diseases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and sarcoidosis have been the focus of a growing number of epidemiological investigations on the risk of environmental and occupational exposures. To date, the consistency of epidemiological evidence is suggestive of a causal relationship between several environmental exposures and IPF, with the strongest evidence for cigarette smoking and metal dust. Current knowledge about pathogenesis provides further support for a causal link. However, scant epidemiological evidence for dose-response and temporality weaken the case for making causal inferences. In contrast to IPF, the quantity of epidemiological evidence for environmental exposures and sarcoidosis is smaller. Two studies provide consistent evidence for exposures to agricultural dust and musty odor/mold/mildew, and studies among military personnel and firefighters suggest mixed dust and fume exposures as risk factors for sarcoidosis. Although studies of the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis also provide evidence supporting environmental causation, more epidemiological studies are needed to establish consistency of associations, dose-response, and temporality. Future investigations, of gene-environment interaction offer the potential for strengthening the evidence of causation between several environmental and occupational exposures and idiopathic lung diseases.},

Given the variable quality of current exposure assessment techniques, we suggest methods to improve assessments, including the incorporation of hygiene measurements: using data from administrative exposure databases; using results of studies identifying determinants of exposure to develop questionnaires; and where reasonable given latency and biological half life considerations, directly measuring exposures of study subjects.},

  Abstract                 = {Several clinical trials have recently targeted specific pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, IPF remains plagued by a median survival of 3 yrs and emphasises the need for further research with new insights and perspectives. The prevailing pathogenic hypotheses assume that either an inflammatory process or an independent epithelial/fibroblastic disorder may propagate the disease process. Based on knowledge developed with considerable scientific evidence, we provide our perspectives with an alternative point of view that IPF be considered as a neoproliferative disorder of the lung. Genetic alterations, response to growth and inhibitory signals, resistance to apoptosis, myofibroblast origin and behaviour, altered cellular communications, and intracellular signalling pathways are all fundamental pathogenic hallmarks of both IPF and cancer. The concept of IPF as a lethal malignant disorder of the lung might extend beyond the pathogenic link between these two diseases and disclose new pathogenic mechanisms leading to novel therapeutic options, adopted from cancer biology. Moreover, this vision might dawn the awareness of the public, political and scientific community of this devastating disease from an angle different from the current perception and provoke new ideas and studies to get a better understanding to control the otherwise relentless progressive disease.},

Wacholder et al. Am J Epidemiol 1992;135:1029-50). In this paper, a theoretical framework for selecting controls in case-control studies is developed. Three principles of comparability are described: 1) study base, that all comparisons be made within the study base; 2) deconfounding, that comparisons of the effects of the levels of exposure on disease risk not be distorted by the effects of other factors; and 3) comparable accuracy, that any errors in measurement of exposure be nondifferential between cases and controls. These principles, if adhered to in a study, can reduce selection, confounding, and information bias, respectively. The principles, however, are constrained by an additional efficiency principle regarding resources and time. Most problems and controversies in control selection reflect trade-offs among these four principles.},

The occupational exposure to mineral dust has been coded for 189 of these cases. There is good correlation between the severity of asbestosis and the coded exposures, electron microscopic mineral fibre count, and the fibre count as seen under the light microscope. The information collected showed that mesotheliomas occurred in those who had had minimal or slight asbestosis, by contrast with the pulmonary carcinomas found in those with moderate to severe asbestosis. The amphibole (crocidolite and amosite) lung content correlated with severity of asbestosis.},

Among those with 40 years or more since entering the trade, 41.5\% had radiographic signs of asbestos-related disease, 24.2\% pleural alone, 7.7\% parenchymal alone, and 9.6\% both pleural and parenchymal abnormalities. After controlling for several surrogates for asbestos exposure level, cigarette smoking was found to increase risk of parenchymal, and more modestly, pleural abnormalities. Each pack-year was associated with a 1\% increased prevalence odds ratios for parenchymal abnormalities (ILO category 1 compared to category 0), and 0.4\% increased prevalence odds ratios for pleural abnormalities. A history of shipyard employment also produced significantly increased prevalence odds ratios for each radiographic category. More that 90\% of chest radiographs were classified by A or B readers; after adjustment for other risk factors, A readers were more likely to report parenchymal abnormalities of category 1, but not more likely to report category 2 or pleural abnormalities, than B readers.},

  abstract     = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias and is characterised by progressive accumulation of scar tissue in the lungs. The objective of this study was to describe the current mortality rates due to IPF in Europe, based on the World Health Organization (WHO) mortality database.We used country-level data for IPF mortality, identified in the WHO mortality database using International Classification of Diseases 10th Edition (ICD-10) codes, for the period 2001-2013. Joinpoint analysis was performed to describe trends throughout the observation period.The median mortality was 3.75 per 100 000 (interquartile range (IQR) 1.37-5.30) and 1.50 per 100 000 (IQR 0.65-2.02) for males and females, respectively. IPF mortality increased in the majority of the European Union (EU) countries with the exceptions of Denmark, Croatia, Austria and Romania. There was a significant disparity in rates across Europe, in the range 0.41-12.1 per 100 000 for men and 0.24-5.63 per 100 000 for women. The most notable increases were observed in the United Kingdom and Finland. Rates were also substantially higher in males, with sex disparity increasing across the period.The reported IPF mortality appears to be increasing across the EU; however, there is substantial variation in mortality trends and overall reported mortality rates between countries.},

  abstract     = {Multidisciplinary team (MDT) diagnosis is regarded as the diagnostic reference standard for interstitial lung disease (ILD). Several studies have reported that MDT diagnosis is associated with higher levels of diagnostic confidence and better interobserver agreement when compared to the individual components of the MDT in isolation. Although this recommendation is widely accepted, no guideline statement specifies what constitutes an MDT meeting and how its participants should govern it. Furthermore, the precise role of an MDT meeting in the setting of ILD may vary from one group to another. For example, in some cases, the meeting will confine its discussion to characterising the disease and formulating diagnosis. In others, management decisions may also be part of the discussion. Surprisingly, there is no consensus on how MDT diagnosis is validated. As multidisciplinary evaluation contains all the available clinical information on an individual patient, there is no reference standard against which the veracity of MDT diagnosis can be tested. Finally, many of these uncertainties surrounding MDT meeting practice are unlikely to be answered by traditional evidence-based studies, which create difficulties when generating guideline recommendations. There is clearly a need for expert consensus on what constitutes acceptable MDT meeting practice. This consensus will need to be flexible to accommodate the variability in resources available to fledgling MDT groups and the variable nature of patients requiring discussion.},

  abstract        = {This article provides a review and synthesis of the published and selected unpublished literature on historical asbestos exposures among skilled craftsmen in various nonshipyard and shipyard settings. The specific crafts evaluated were insulators, pipefitters, boilermakers, masons, welders, sheet-metal workers, millwrights, electricians, carpenters, painters, laborers, maintenance workers, and abatement workers. Over 50 documents were identified and summarized. Sufficient information was available to quantitatively characterize historical asbestos exposures for the most highly exposed workers (insulators), even though data were lacking for some job tasks or time periods. Average airborne fiber concentrations collected for the duration of the task and/or the entire work shift were found to range from about 2 to 10 fibers per cubic centimeter (cm3 or cc) during activities performed by insulators in various nonshipyard settings from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Higher exposure levels were observed for this craft during the 1940s to 1950s, when dust counts were converted from millions of particles per cubic foot (mppcf) to units of fibers per cubic centimeter (fibers/cc) using a 1:6 conversion factor. Similar tasks performed in U.S. shipyards yielded average fiber concentrations about two-fold greater, likely due to inadequate ventilation and confined work environments; however, excessively high exposure levels were reported in some British Naval shipyards due to the spraying of asbestos. Improved industrial hygiene practices initiated in the early to mid-1970s were found to reduce average fiber concentrations for insulator tasks approximately two- to five-fold. For most other crafts, average fiber concentrations were found to typically range from <0.01 to 1 fibers/cc (depending on the task or time period), with higher concentrations observed during the use of powered tools, the mixing or sanding of drywall cement, and the cleanup of asbestos insulation or lagging materials. The available evidence suggests that although many historical measurements exceeded the current OSHA 8-h time-weighted average (TWA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 fibers/cc, average fiber concentrations generally did not exceed historical occupational exposure limits in place at the time, except perhaps during ripout activities or the spraying of asbestos in enclosed spaces or onboard ships. Additionally, reported fiber concentrations may not have represented daily or actual human exposures to asbestos, since few samples were collected beyond specific short-term tasks and workers sometimes wore respiratory protective equipment. The available data were not sufficient to determine whether the airborne fiber concentrations represented serpentine or amphibole asbestos fibers, which would have a pronounced impact on the potential health hazards posed by the asbestos. Despite a number of limitations associated with the available air sampling data, the information should provide guidance for reconstructing asbestos exposures for different crafts in specific occupational settings where asbestos was present during the 1940 to 2006 time period.},

We recruited 92 patients with chronic fibrosing IIP and 92 matched controls who had normal chest radiograph findings by age and gender. We used a structured exposure questionnaire to evaluate potential occupational and environmental risk factors for chronic fibrosing IIP, with adjustments for age, smoking, and clinical risk factors. We used conditional logistic regression models to analyze associations with chronic fibrosing IIP adjusted for age, smoking and clinical risk factors. Exposure to stone, sand, or silica significantly increased the risk of chronic fibrosing IIP (odds ratio = 5.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-24.21) CONCLUSIONS:: Our findings indicate that exposure to stone, sand, and silica might constitute a risk factor for developing chronic fibrosing IIP in the Korean population.},

However, the association between exposure to inorganic particles and the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)/usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is obscure. We examined inorganic particles in the pulmonary hilar lymph nodes affected by IPF/UIP to investigate whether inhaled elements are involved in the etiology, and whether there is an increasing risk of developing IPF/UIP. Twenty-three IPF/UIP cases and 23 controls without IPF/UIP were investigated. Pulmonary hilar lymph nodes constituted the study material. The elemental analysis was performed using scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope, and we analyzed particles quantitatively and qualitatively. The results showed that the cases contained silicon and aluminum as compared with the control in lymph nodes, and these deposits were statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of IPF/UIP (adjusted odds were 2.99, 95% CI: 1.29-6.85 and 57.84, 95% CI: 1.45-2306.19, respectively). In addition, higher nickel levels in lymph nodes were associated with lung cancer. This study shows that inorganic particles, such as Si and Al, have higher concentrations in the hilar lymph nodes in IPF/UIP, and may play a role in one of the risk factors in the pathogenesis of IPF/UIP.},

Additionally, when searching for more general topics, the same approach may return hundreds of unranked references. To address these issues, text mining tools have been developed to help scientists focus on relevant abstracts. We have implemented the MedlineRanker webserver, which allows a flexible ranking of Medline for a topic of interest without expert knowledge. Given some abstracts related to a topic, the program deduces automatically the most discriminative words in comparison to a random selection. These words are used to score other abstracts, including those from not yet annotated recent publications, which can be then ranked by relevance. We show that our tool can be highly accurate and that it is able to process millions of abstracts in a practical amount of time.

The true incidence and prevalence of the disease are unknown. In general, the overall prevalence and incidence reported in European and Asian countries are lower than those reported in American studies. In recent years, the epidemiological approach to IPF has been difficult for many reasons. First, the diagnostic criteria of the disease have changed over time. Secondly, the coding system used for IPF in administrative databases, the most common data source used to study this aspect of the disease, has been modified in the past few years. Finally, the study design, the methodology and the population selected in each of the studies are very different. All these aspects make comparisons among studies very difficult or impossible. In this review, we list the main issues that might arise when comparing different studies and that should be taken into consideration when describing the state of epidemiological knowledge concerning this pathology.},

  abstract     = {Late presentation is common in mesothelioma. Reliable assessment of past exposure to asbestos is a necessary first step for risk attribution and for the development of a future screening programme. Such a programme could maximise access to trials of novel therapies and would pave the way for development of novel chemoprophylaxis strategies. This paper describes a method for individual exposure reconstruction along with data from a validation study. The exposure assessment method uses only descriptive information about the circumstances of the work that could be obtained from questioning the worker. The assessment is based on the tasks carried out and includes parameters for substance emission potential, activity emission potential, the effectiveness of any local control measures, passive emission, the fractional time the asbestos source is active and the efficiency of any respiratory protection worn. There was a good association between the estimated and measured exposure levels. Pearson's correlation coefficient between the log-transformed measurements and estimates from the model was 0.86, and 95% of the estimated individual values were within about a factor of ten of the associated measured value. The method described would be suitable for pre-selecting individuals at high risk of malignant pleural mesothelioma for screening using appropriate tools and/or enrolment in clinical trials of chemo-prophylaxis. This method is of potential clinical value in developing novel treatment approaches for mesothelioma. Pilot studies to test this approach are urgently needed.},

  abstract        = {Occupational exposure data on asbestos are limited and poorly integrated in Australia so that estimates of disease risk and attribution of disease causation are usually calculated from data that are not specific for local conditions. To develop a job-exposure matrix (AsbJEM) to estimate occupational asbestos exposure levels in Australia, making optimal use of the available exposure data. A dossier of all available exposure data in Australia and information on industry practices and controls was provided to an expert panel consisting of three local industrial hygienists with thorough knowledge of local and international work practices. The expert panel estimated asbestos exposures for combinations of occupation, industry, and time period. Intensity and frequency grades were estimated to enable the calculation of annual exposure levels for each occupation-industry combination for each time period. Two indicators of asbestos exposure intensity (mode and peak) were used to account for different patterns of exposure between occupations. Additionally, the probable type of asbestos fibre was determined for each situation. Asbestos exposures were estimated for 537 combinations of 224 occupations and 60 industries for four time periods (1943-1966; 1967-1986; 1987-2003; ≥2004). Workers in the asbestos manufacturing, shipyard, and insulation industries were estimated to have had the highest average exposures. Up until 1986, 46 occupation-industry combinations were estimated to have had exposures exceeding the current Australian exposure standard of 0.1 f ml(-1). Over 90% of exposed occupations were considered to have had exposure to a mixture of asbestos varieties including crocidolite. The AsbJEM provides empirically based quantified estimates of asbestos exposure levels for Australian jobs since 1943. This exposure assessment application will contribute to improved understanding and prediction of asbestos-related diseases and attribution of disease causation.},

We describe a quantitative exposure assessment approach for five lung carcinogens (i.e. asbestos, chromium-VI, nickel, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (by its proxy benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)) and respirable crystalline silica). A quantitative job-exposure matrix (JEM) was developed based on statistical modeling of large quantities of personal measurements. Empirical linear models were developed using personal occupational exposure measurements (n = 102306) from Europe and Canada, as well as auxiliary information like job (industry), year of sampling, region, an a priori exposure rating of each job (none, low, and high exposed), sampling and analytical methods, and sampling duration. The model outcomes were used to create a JEM with a quantitative estimate of the level of exposure by job, year, and region. Decreasing time trends were observed for all agents between the 1970s and 2009, ranging from -1.2% per year for personal BaP and nickel exposures to -10.7% for asbestos (in the time period before an asbestos ban was implemented). Regional differences in exposure concentrations (adjusted for measured jobs, years of measurement, and sampling method and duration) varied by agent, ranging from a factor 3.3 for chromium-VI up to a factor 10.5 for asbestos. We estimated time-, job-, and region-specific exposure levels for four (asbestos, chromium-VI, nickel, and RCS) out of five considered lung carcinogens. Through statistical modeling of large amounts of personal occupational exposure measurement data we were able to derive a quantitative JEM to be used in community-based studies.},

  abstract        = {Mortality reports on asbestos exposed cohorts which gave information on exposure levels from which (as a minimum) a cohort average cumulative exposure could be estimated were reviewed. At exposure levels seen in occupational cohorts it is concluded that the exposure specific risk of mesothelioma from the three principal commercial asbestos types is broadly in the ratio 1:100:500 for chrysotile, amosite and crocidolite respectively. For lung cancer the conclusions are less clear cut. Cohorts exposed only to crocidolite or amosite record similar exposure specific risk levels (around 5% excess lung cancer per f/ml.yr); but chrysotile exposed cohorts show a less consistent picture, with a clear discrepancy between the mortality experience of a cohort of xhrysotile textile workers in Carolina and the Quebec miners cohort. Taking account of the excess risk recorded by cohorts with mixed fibre exposures (generally<1%), the Carolina experience looks uptypically high. It is suggested that a best estimate lung cancer risk for chrysotile alone would be 0.1%, with a highest reasonable estimate of 0.5%. The risk differential between chrysotile and the two amphibole fibres for lunc cancer is thus between 1:10 and 1:50. Examination of the inter-study dose response relationship for the amphibole fibres suggests a non-linear relationship for all three cancer endpoints (pleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas, and lung cancer). The peritoneal mesothelioma risk is proportional to the square of cumulative exposure, lung cancer risk lies between a linear and square relationship and pleural mesothelioma seems to rise less than linearly with cumulative dose. Although these non-linear relationships provide a best fit ot the data, statistical and other uncertainties mean that a linear relationship remains arguable for pleural and lung tumours (but not or peritoneal tumours). Based on these considerations, and a discussion fo the associated uncertainties, a series of quantified risk summary statements for different elvels of cumulative exposure are presented.},

  abstract        = {Mesothelioma deaths due to environmental exposure to asbestos in The Netherlands led to parliamentary concern that exposure guidelines were not strict enough. The Health Council of the Netherlands was asked for advice. Its report has recently been published. The question of quality of the exposure estimates was studied more systematically than in previous asbestos meta-analyses. Five criteria of quality of exposure information were applied, and cohort studies that failed to meet these were excluded. For lung cancer, this decreased the number of cohorts included from 19 to 3 and increased the risk estimate 3- to 6-fold, with the requirements for good historical data on exposure and job history having the largest effects. It also suggested that the apparent differences in lung cancer potency between amphiboles and chrysotile may be produced by lower quality studies. A similar pattern was seen for mesothelioma. As a result, the Health Council has proposed that the occupational exposure limit be reduced from 10 000 fibres m(-3) (all types) to 250 f m(-3) (amphiboles), 1300 f m(-3) (mixed fibres), and 2000 f m(-3) (chrysotile). The process illustrates the importance of evaluating quality of exposure in epidemiology since poor quality of exposure data will lead to underestimated risk.},

These methods involve extrapolation of risks observed at past relatively high asbestos concentration levels down to usually much lower concentration levels of interest today--in some cases, orders of magnitude lower. These models are used to calculate estimates of the potential risk to workers manufacturing asbestos products and to students enrolled in schools containing asbestos products. The potential risk to workers exposed for 40 yr to 0.5 fibers per milliliter (f/ml) of mixed asbestos fiber type (a permissible workplace exposure limit under consideration by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ) are estimated as 82 lifetime excess cancers per 10,000 exposed. The risk to students exposed to an average asbestos concentration of 0.001 f/ml of mixed asbestos fiber types for an average enrollment period of 6 school years is estimated as 5 lifetime excess cancers per one million exposed. If the school exposure is to chrysotile asbestos only, then the estimated risk is 1.5 lifetime excess cancers per million. Risks from other causes are presented for comparison; e.g., annual rates (per million) of 10 deaths from high school football, 14 from bicycling (10-14 yr of age), 5 to 20 for whooping cough vaccination. Decisions concerning asbestos products require participation of all parties involved and should only be made after a scientifically defensible estimate of the associated risk has been obtained. In many cases to date, such decisions have been made without adequate consideration of the level of risk or the cost-effectiveness of attempts to lower the potential risk.},

The main focus is on yet unresolved issues which introduce a large margin of uncertainty into the published quantitative risk assessments: 1) Are all asbestos types equally dangerous or is chrysotile asbestos less dangerous than amphiboles? 2) Are health effects of asbestos fibres threshold or non-threshold effects? 3) Are errors in mathematical modelling of risks so great as to make the risk evaluations worthless? Attention is also given to errors in estimates of past exposures, uncertainties and unspecificities of models and to the unfeasibility of practical application of some well recognized risk assessment models.},

The local clinic and health screening program collects data from participants on past occupational and environmental exposures to vermiculite and asbestos. Health studies among this population have demonstrated associations between amphibole exposure and health outcomes, but critical questions regarding the nature and level of exposure associated with specific outcomes remain unanswered. The objective of this study was to develop a comprehensive exposure assessment approach that integrates information on individuals' contact frequency with multiple exposure pathways. For 3031 participants, we describe cumulative exposure metrics for environmental exposures, occupational exposures, and residents' contact with carry-home asbestos from household workers. As expected, cumulative exposures for all three occupational categories were higher among men compared with women, and cumulative exposures for household contact and environmental pathways were higher among women. The comprehensive exposure assessment strategies will advance health studies and risk assessment approaches in this population with a complex history of both occupational and environmental asbestos exposure.},

Among job periods assessed as unexposed by either JEM, 96% are recognized as such by the SQ. Discrepancies between the SQ and JEM were observed in jobs rated potentially exposed by the JEM. Despite varying estimates, the JEM and SQ were consistent as regards the relative classification of job periods by probability of exposure. The concordance of the methods, estimated by Kappa statistics, was stronger for the two JEM than for either of the JEM and the SQ. The identification of specific occupation/industry combinations in which discrepancies were most frequent and the comparison with expert ratings in some jobs yield insights into the sources of the disagreement between the methods. The misclassification of exposure by the JEM usually results in an overestimation of exposure. This is essentially related to loss of information due to the use of job codes as surrogates for job task descriptions and to the insufficiency of published data on asbestos exposure in different industries. As regards the SQ, two main sources of potential loss of sensitivity were identified: 1) possible omission of indirect sources of exposure by this method, 2) possible incompleteness of the SQ. The present comparison of methods of asbestos exposure assessment does not allow any one approach to be considered superior to another. Indeed, as proposed by Ahrens et al. in Part I of the study, both should be used to ensure optimal epidemiological performance.},

International Journal of Epidemiology 1993; 22 (Suppl. 2): S83-S95. In a lung cancer study in Northern Germany the asbestos exposure assessment obtained from detailed supplementary questionnaires (SQ) was compared to the assessment obtained by the application of two job exposure matrices (JEM) to the job history. The study includes 391 incident male cases and the same number of controls from the general population, matched by sex, age, and region. Almost 16% of the subjects are considered as never having been exposed to asbestos and 24% are classified as certainly exposed according to both of the JEM, the corresponding percentages of the SQ-method being 68% and 32%. Sixty percent are considered by the JEM as having an intermediate probability of exposure. In general, the agreement between the different methods is better when the exposure definition is restricted to definite exposures, the corresponding Kappa statistic being 0.67 for the comparison between both JEM and 0.44/0.39 between the JEM and the SQ. The positive agreement between SQ and JEM (reference) increases from 12% and 17% for subjects with low probability of exposure to 61% and 69% for those with definite exposures. A ranking according to cumulative exposure shows some dose-response relationship for each of the three methods with a smoking-adjusted OR in the highest category of 1.85 (95% CI: 1.01-3.38) for the SQ method and 2.47 (95% CI: 1.40-4.37) and 2.94 (95% CI: 1.73-4.99) for the two JEM. The results are discussed with reference to the conceptual differences between the methods and their potential scope in future studies.},

  abstract        = {Casale Monferrato (north west Italy) is an area with an exceptionally high incidence of mesothelioma caused by asbestos contamination at work and in the general environment from the asbestos-cement Eternit plant that was operational until 1986. The purpose of this study was to quantify the association between pleural malignant mesothelioma (PMM) and asbestos cumulative exposure using individual assessment of environmental and domestic exposure, as well as of occupational exposure. This population-based case-control study included cases of PMM diagnosed between January 2001 and June 2006 among residents in the Casale Monferrato Local Health Authority. Population controls were randomly sampled, matched by age and sex to cases. Cumulative exposure was estimated to account for the lifelong exposure history. Analyses were conducted using unconditional logistic regression models adjusting for gender, age at diagnosis and type of interview (direct or proxy respondents). 200 PMM cases of 223 eligible cases (89.7%) and 348 (63%) of 552 eligible controls accepted to be interviewed. ORs increased with cumulative exposure index (p<0.0001) from 4.4 (CI 95% 1.7 to 11.3) (<1 f/mL-years) to 62.1 (CI 95% 22.2 to 173.2) (≥10 f/mL-years). Among subjects never occupationally exposed, corresponding ORs were 3.8 (CI 95% 1.3 to 11.1) and 23.3 (CI 95% 2.9 to 186.9) (reference: background level of asbestos exposure). ORs of about 2, statistically significant, were observed for domestic exposure and for living in houses near buildings with large asbestos cement parts. Risk of PMM increased with cumulative asbestos exposure and also in analyses limited to subjects non-occupationally exposed. Our results also provide indication of risk associated with common sources of environmental exposure and are highly relevant for the evaluation of residual risk after the cessation of asbestos industrial use.},

  abstract        = {We have conducted a population-based study of pleural mesothelioma patients with occupational histories and measured asbestos lung burdens in occupationally exposed workers and in the general population. The relationship between lung burden and risk, particularly at environmental exposure levels, will enable future mesothelioma rates in people born after 1965 who never installed asbestos to be predicted from their asbestos lung burdens. Following personal interview asbestos fibres longer than 5 µm were counted by transmission electron microscopy in lung samples obtained from 133 patients with mesothelioma and 262 patients with lung cancer. ORs for mesothelioma were converted to lifetime risks. Lifetime mesothelioma risk is approximately 0.02% per 1000 amphibole fibres per gram of dry lung tissue over a more than 100-fold range, from 1 to 4 in the most heavily exposed building workers to less than 1 in 500 in most of the population. The asbestos fibres counted were amosite (75%), crocidolite (18%), other amphiboles (5%) and chrysotile (2%). The approximate linearity of the dose-response together with lung burden measurements in younger people will provide reasonably reliable predictions of future mesothelioma rates in those born since 1965 whose risks cannot yet be seen in national rates. Burdens in those born more recently will indicate the continuing occupational and environmental hazards under current asbestos control regulations. Our results confirm the major contribution of amosite to UK mesothelioma incidence and the substantial contribution of non-occupational exposure, particularly in women.},

This critique has become even more relevant with the 2014 Helsinki criteria publication, which adopted the 2010 CAP/PPS criteria. Based on our review of these newer criteria and our experience in this field, we find that the CAP-NIOSH 1982 criteria is still the most acceptable method for the pathologic diagnosis and grading of asbestosis, which can be described as pulmonary fibrosis caused by inhalation of asbestos fibers.},

These databases provide grouped descriptive and metrological data from observed situations of occupational exposure, collected through the analysis of scientific articles and technical reports by industrial hygienists. Over 5,000 measurements were collected. We describe the occupations, economic activities, fiber-containing products, and operations on them that have been documented most often. Graphical measurement syntheses of these data show that the situations presented for asbestos and RCF, except mineral wools, report fiber concentrations mainly above historical occupational exposure limits. Free access to these data in French and in English on the Internet (https://ssl2.isped.u-bordeaux2.fr/eva_003/) helps public health and prevention professionals to identify and characterize occupational exposures to fibers. Extended recently to nanoscale particles, Evalutil continues to contribute to the improvement of knowledge about exposure to inhaled particles and the health risks associated with them.},

  abstract    = {In the course of setting up the National Mesothelioma Surveillance Program (PNSM), established in France in 1998, the question arose as to the most suitable method of assessing occupational exposure. The aim of this study was to define the most suitable rating method for assessing occupational asbestos exposure in order to assess medico-social care.The study included 100 subjects-50 cases of mesothelioma and 50 controls-randomly selected and representing 457 jobs held. Job asbestos exposure was assessed by a six-expert panel using two methods: "by job" rating, where all the jobs in were assessed regardless of the subjects; and "by subject" rating, where all the jobs of a subject were assessed at the same time. Consensus was obtained and subjects' exposure was calculated for each rating. Then, two internal experts assessed job asbestos exposure with the "by subject" rating. Kappa coefficients were used to measure agreement between the ratings.Agreement between "by job" and "by subject" ratings was very good for subject probability of exposure (kappa = 0.84) and cumulative exposure index (kappa = 0.80). Agreement between the six-expert panel and the two internal experts was good for subject exposure (kappa for probability = 0.71; kappa for cumulative exposure index= 0.68).This study shows that the two rating systems have good or very good agreement. These results validate the routine use in the PNSM of the "by subject" rating, with the advantage of being convenient and quick to provide feedback on occupational asbestos exposure to mesothelioma cases for compensation.},

All testing took place within an operative automotive repair facility involving passenger cars and a pickup truck ranging in vintage from late 1960s through 1970s. A professional mechanic performed all shop work including engine disassembly and reassembly, gasket manipulation and parts cleaning. Bulk sample analysis of removed gaskets through polarized light microscopy (PLM) revealed asbestos fiber concentrations ranging between 0 and 75%. Personal and area air samples were collected and analyzed using National Institute of Occupational Safety Health (NIOSH) methods 7400 [phase contrast microscopy (PCM)] and 7402 [transmission electron microscopy (TEM)]. Among all air samples collected, approximately 21% (n = 11) contained chrysotile fibers. The mean PCM and phase contrast microscopy equivalent (PCME) 8-h time weighted average (TWA) concentrations for these samples were 0.0031 fibers/cubic centimeters (f/cc) and 0.0017 f/cc, respectively. Based on these findings, automobile mechanics who worked with asbestos-containing gaskets may have been exposed to concentrations of airborne asbestos concentrations approximately 100 times lower than the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 0.1 f/cc.},

The importance of robust and high-quality exposure reconstruction has been recognized by many researchers. It has been noted that misclassification of reconstructed exposures is relatively common and can result in potentially significant effects on the conclusions of a human health risk assessment or epidemiology study. In this analysis, a review of the key exposure reconstruction approaches described in over 400 papers in the peer-reviewed literature is presented. These approaches have been critically evaluated and classified according to quantitative, semiquantitative, and qualitative approaches. Our analysis indicates that much can still be done to improve the overall quality and consistency of exposure reconstructions and that a systematic framework would help to standardize the exposure reconstruction process in the future. The seven recommended steps in the exposure reconstruction process include identifying the goals of the reconstruction, organizing and ranking the available data, identifying key data gaps, selecting the best information sources and methodology for the reconstruction, incorporating probabilistic methods into the reconstruction, conducting an uncertainty analysis, and validating the results of the reconstruction. Influential emerging techniques, such as Bayesian data analysis, are highlighted. Important issues that will likely influence the conduct of exposure reconstruction into the future include improving statistical analysis methods, addressing the issue of chemical mixtures, evaluating aggregate exposures, and ensuring transparency with respect to variability and uncertainty in the reconstruction effort.},

  abstract        = {This article outlines a hierarchy of data required for retrospective exposure assessment for occupational disease of an individual worker. It then outlines in a step-wise manner how trend analysis using a relatively large exposure database can be used to estimate such exposure. The process of how a large database containing exposure measurements can be prepared for estimating historic occupational exposures of individual workers in relation to their illnesses is described. The asbestos subset from a large government collected air monitoring database called Medical Surveillance (MESU) was selected to illustrate the cleaning and analysis processes. After unidentifiable values were removed, the cleaned dataset was examined for possible sources of variability such as changes to sampling protocol. Limit of detection (LOD) values were substituted for all non-detectable values prior to the calculation of descriptive statistic using left censored analysis methods (i.e., maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), Kaplan Meier (KM), and simple substitution). The JoinPoint Regression Program was used to perform trend analysis and calculate an annual percentage change (APC) value for the available sampling period. An asbestos case study is presented to illustrate how the APC can then be combined with more recent job and/or process specific exposure data to estimate historic levels. The MESU asbestos dataset contained 1,610 samples from 1984-1995. An average of 17% of this data was left censored. The asbestos air sampling methods in Ontario changed around 1990. LOD values of 0.06 f/cc and 0.02 f/cc were substituted for LOD values pre- and post-1990, respectively. The annual mean fiber levels for the MLE method were an average of 44% lower than KM and substitution methods. The corresponding APC for MLE method was -6.5% and -7.7% for KM and simple substitution. The findings of this paper illustrate how the temporal trend of an exposure databases can be used to efficiently estimate historic contaminant levels in the presence of limited historical information.},

  abstract        = {To estimate the proportion of pleural mesothelioma cases that can be attributed to asbestos exposure in France including non-occupational exposure. A population-based case-control study including 437 incident cases and 874 controls was conducted from 1998 to 2002. Occupational and non-occupational asbestos exposure was assessed retrospectively by two expert hygienists. ORs of pleural mesothelioma for asbestos-exposed subjects compared to non-exposed subjects, and population-attributable risk (ARp) of asbestos exposure were estimated using a conditional logistic regression. A clear dose-response relationship was observed between occupational asbestos exposure and pleural mesothelioma (OR=4.0 (99% CI 1.9 to 8.3) for men exposed at less than 0.1 f/mL-year vs. 67.0 (99% CI 25.6 to 175.1) for men exposed at more than 10 f/mL-year). The occupational asbestos ARp was 83.1% (99% CI 74.5% to 91.7%) for men and 41.7% (99% CI 25.3% to 58.0%) for women. A higher risk of pleural mesothelioma was observed in subjects non-occupationally exposed to asbestos compared to those never exposed. The non-occupational asbestos ARp for these subjects was 20.0% (99% CI -33.5% to 73.5%) in men and 38.7% (99% CI 8.4% to 69.0%) in women. When considering all kinds of asbestos exposure, ARp was 87.3% (99% CI 78.9% to 95.7%) for men and 64.8% (99% CI 45.4% to 84.3%) for women. Our study suggests that the overall ARp in women is largely driven by non-occupational asbestos exposure arguing for the strong impact of such exposure in pleural mesothelioma occurrence. Considering the difficulty in assessing domestic or environmental asbestos exposure, this could explain the observed difference in ARp between men and women.},

A special feature of this database is that only multiple measurements of exposure from the same workers were included. This enabled estimation of within- and between-worker variance components of occupational exposure to chemical agents throughout industry. Most of the groups were not uniformly exposed as is generally assumed by occupational hygienists. In fact only 42 out of a total of 165 groups (25%), based on job title and factory, had 95% of individual mean exposures within a two-fold range. On the contrary, about 30% of the groups had 95% of individual mean exposures in a range which was greater than 10-fold. Environmental and production factors were shown to have distinct influences on the within-worker (day-to-day) variability, but not on the between-worker variability. Groups working outdoors and those working without local exhaust ventilation showed more day-to-day variability than groups working indoors and those working with local exhaust ventilation. Groups consisting of mobile workers, those working with an intermittent process and those where the source of contamination was either local or mobile also showed great day-to-day variability. In a multivariate regression model, environment (indoors-outdoors) and type of process (continuous-intermittent) explained 41% of the variability in the within-worker component of variance. Another model, in which only type of process (continuous-intermittent) had a significant effect, explained only 13% of the variability in the between-worker component of variance.},

This article presents a theoretical analysis of such differences using a simple model of exposure, implemented as a two-compartment mass balance model with a constant emission rate. Simulated exposure levels (termed the near-field) and the concentration at a fixed location (the far-field) were obtained for five room sizes (30 to 3000 m3), each with five general ventilation rates (0.3 to 30 air-changes per hour) and three levels of air movement in the vicinity of the worker (generally 3 to 30 m3/min). The ratio of near- to far-field concentrations from the simulations ranged from unity in small poorly ventilated rooms to 24 in large well ventilated areas, which compares favorably with actual measurement data. The predicted concentrations obtained in small rooms (< 100 m3) with less than one air-change per hour were almost 40 times higher than in larger rooms. The results from these simulations have been used to modify the original exposure model to better reflect the likely effect of general ventilation on workers' exposure.},

The exposure axis is made up of 49 chemical, physical, and biological agents, most of which are known or suspected causes of occupational disease. In the body of the matrix associations between jobs and exposures are graded to four levels. The matrix has been applied to data from a case-control study of lung cancer in which occupational histories were elicited by means of a postal questionnaire. Estimates of exposure to five known or suspected carcinogens (asbestos, chromates, cutting oils, formaldehyde, and inhaled polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were compared with those obtained by detailed review of individual occupational histories. When the matrix was used exposures were attributed to jobs more frequently than on the basis of individual histories. Lung cancer was significantly more common among subjects classed by the matrix as having potential exposure to chromates, but neither method of assigning exposures produced statistically significant associations with asbestos or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Possible explanations for the failure to show a clear effect of these known carcinogens are discussed. The greater accuracy of exposures inferred directly from individual histories was reflected in steeper dose response curves for asbestos, chromates, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

We applied this system (NOHS-JEM) to the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program (CSP) to see how many cancer cases could be assigned asbestos exposure and how asbestos exposure affected mesothelioma risk. Using the same CSP data, our "experts" classified asbestos exposure simply by occupation and industry. Both exposure classifications were divided into low and high; the NOHS-JEM by the number of exposed people per couplet, and ours by judgements of intensity. Odds ratios (OR) for mesothelioma risk for low and high asbestos exposure for the NOHS-JEM were 2.0 (95% C.I. 1.2-3.4) and 2.5 (95% C.I. 1.2-4.8). For ours, corresponding risks were 1.6 (95% C.I. 1.1-2.4) and 6.3 (95% C.I. 2.5-15.1). Our system was able to assign more cases to couplets then the NOHS-JEM (35,895 to 22,369). Three limitations of the NOHS-JEM were that many occupation-industry couplets were not classified at all, many couplets associated with past asbestos exposure (before the 1972-1974 NOHS survey) were not classified as asbestos exposure, and no assessment of intensity was made. These limitations may apply to other exposures and should be carefully considered before the NOHS-JEM is applied to other case-control studies.},

Three methods for assessing exposure to asbestos from case-control data on mesothelioma, including next-of-kin assessment, expert assessment, and use of a generic job-exposure matrix (JEM). Interview data [Spirtas et al. (1994): Occup Environ Med 51:804-811] were reviewed to determine exposure status by an occupational hygienist (C.R.) who was unaware of disease status. Exposure odds ratios were calculated using standard methods, and measures of agreement included the kappa statistic and conditional and marginal odds ratios. Expert assessment detected higher proportions of exposed subjects than the next-of-kin respondents or JEM methods. The disease-exposure odds ratios were highest for respondents, perhaps because of recall bias, and lowest for the JEM method. The agreement was highest between the respondent and expert assessments. A combination of respondent's assessment and JEM assessment led to the best prediction of the expert's assessment. Results for spouse respondents were similar to those for other "next-of-kin" respondents. Expert assessments were the most plausible, but the data indicate that disease associations could also be detected with the other exposure assessment methods. Using some combination of the proxy respondent's assessment and the JEM assessment, one can predict the expert's assessment. A strategy that relied on the respondent's assessment when it was positive and otherwise obtained an expert assessment could reduce costs with little error, compared to expert assessment on all subjects.},

Several methodologies exist for estimating exposures retrospectively, of which case-by-case expert assessment and job-exposure matrices (JEMs) are commonly used. This study evaluated the reliability of exposure estimates for selected carcinogens obtained through three JEMs by comparing the estimates with case-by-case expert assessment within the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS). The NLCS includes 58,279 men aged 55-69 years at enrolment in 1986. For a subcohort of these men (n=1630), expert assessment is available for exposure to asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and welding fumes. Reliability of the different JEMs (DOMJEM (asbestos, PAHs), FINJEM (asbestos, PAHs and welding fumes) and Asbestos JEM (asbestos) was determined by assessing the agreement between these JEMs and the expert assessment. Expert assessment revealed the lowest prevalence of exposure for all three exposures (asbestos 9.3%; PAHs 5.3%; welding fumes 11.7%). The DOMJEM showed the highest level of agreement with the expert assessment for asbestos and PAHs (κs=0.29 and 0.42, respectively), closely followed by the FINJEM. For welding fumes, concordance between the expert assessment and FINJEM was high (κ=0.70). The Asbestos JEM showed poor agreement with the expert asbestos assessment (κ=0.10). This study shows case-by-case expert assessment to result in the lowest prevalence of occupational exposure in the NLCS. Furthermore, the DOMJEM and FINJEM proved to be rather similar in agreement when compared with the expert assessment. The Asbestos JEM appeared to be less appropriate for use in the NLCS.},

The multivariable-adjusted model showed overall positive associations between all levels of asbestos exposure and mesothelioma, lung cancer, and laryngeal cancer. Lung adenocarcinoma and glottis cancer showed only a positive association after prolonged higher asbestos exposure (hazard ratio per 10 years increment, 1.43 [95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.93] and 1.95 [95% confidence interval, 1.36 to 2.80], respectively).

Different methods have been developed, including case-by-case expert assessment and job-exposure matrices (JEM). The present analyses compare exposure prevalence and risk estimates derived by different exposure assessment methods. In the context of a case-control study conducted in seven European countries, exposure was estimated for asbestos, diesel motor emissions (DME) and crystalline silica, using three different assessment methods. First, experts assigned exposures to all reported jobs on a case-by-case basis. Second, a population-specific JEM (PSJEM) was developed using the expert assessments of controls only, and re-applied to all study subjects. Third, an independent general population JEM (GPJEM) was created by occupational exposure experts not involved in the original study, and applied to study subjects. Results from these methods were compared. There was poor to fair agreement in assigned exposure between expert assessment and the GPJEM (kappas: asbestos 0.17; DME 0.48; silica 0.38). Exposure prevalence was significantly heterogeneous (p<0.01) between countries for all three agents and assessment methods. For asbestos and DME, significant country heterogeneity in risk estimates was observed when using expert assessment. When applying the GPJEM, the heterogeneity in risk estimates for asbestos and, to some extent, silica diminished. It has been previously advocated that the expert assessment approach to assign exposures based on detailed questionnaire responses provides more accurate exposure estimates than JEM-based results. However, current results demonstrated little, if any, advantage of case-by-case assessment when compared to a JEM approach.},

The relative influence of U and V on the bias in R depends both on R and on P(E), with U tending to be more influential at higher values of P(E). When there is misclassification of exposure, variation in P(E) may bias comparisons of relative risk between groups or exposures, either by producing spurious differences or by masking true differences, and may generate spurious trends associated with a third variable such as age. Because the possible effects of misclassification of exposure on relative risk are complex and not easily generalized, the potential degree of bias should be evaluated individually in each situation.},

In the context of a large case-control study, it was possible to compare self-reports with expert assessment, in which a team of industrial hygienists and chemists examined each job history individually and decided on likelihood of exposure. The subjects were 1,910 males who had participated in a population-based case-control study of cancer and occupational exposures conducted in Montreal, Canada, between 1979 and 1985. For each of 11 substances, the two methods of exposure assessment were compared by means of a kappa statistic and by computing the sensitivity and specificity of self-assessment against expert assessment. Kappa values ranged from 0.33 to 0.64. Compared with the expert assessment, specificities of the self-assessment were generally high (0.83-0.97, with a median of 0.90), but sensitivities were low (0.39-0.91, with a median of 0.61). The authors conclude that self-reports of occupational exposure are not sufficiently accurate to warrant their sole use in most community-based studies.},

These were analysed in a matched case-control study nested within this cohort, to compare different methods of characterizing exposure to asbestos. Self-reported exposure was contrasted with a job exposure matrix (JEM) of five levels of exposure intensity, applied to the job at the time of health check-up. Smoking adjusted odds ratios were computed and the JEM performed better than self-reported exposure, in being able to discriminate high risk subgroups. The same pattern was evident in a parallel analysis of 41 mesotheliomas. However both measures appeared subject to misclassification, and the question put seemed to pick up the use of asbestos cement products more effectively than asbestos insulation products. It is concluded that a simple JEM can be more reliable than a simple question, but that both should be much more detailed, to take account of different types of asbestos exposure and their variation over time.},

Between 1987 and 1993, 405 cases and 387 controls were interviewed. The job histories of these subjects were evaluated by a group of experts for exposure to asbestos fibers according to probability, intensity, and frequency. A cumulative exposure index was calculated as the product of these three parameters and the duration of the exposed job, summed over the entire working life. Among men, the odds ratio increased with the probability of exposure and was 1.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-1.9) for possible exposure and 3.6 (95% CI 2.4-5.3) for definite exposure. A dose-response relation was observed with the cumulative exposure index: The odds ratio increased from 1.2 (95% CI 0.8-1.8) for the lowest exposure category to 8.7 (95% CI 4.1-18.5) for the highest. Among women, the odds ratio for possible or definite exposure was 18.8 (95% CI 4.1-86.2). We found a clear dose-response relation between cumulative asbestos exposure and pleural mesothelioma in a population-based case-control study with retrospective assessment of exposure. A significant excess of mesothelioma was observed for levels of cumulative exposure that were probably far below the limits adopted in most industrial countries during the 1980s.},

  abstract        = {While many studies have quantified the sources of variation in exposure to workplace contaminants for individual groups of workers, patterns of exposure variability have not been investigated since a comprehensive evaluation was carried out over 10 years ago. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify studies that applied the one-way random-effects model to describe exposure profiles of groups of workers classified on the basis of the kind of work performed and where it was performed. Quantitative estimates of the sources of variation in exposure along with information related to the workplace, contaminant and sampling strategy were compiled. For subsets of the data, based upon the classification scheme used to group workers, weighted empirical cumulative distribution functions were constructed and compared using the non-parametric Kolomogorov-Smirnov two-sample test. Further stratifications evaluated differences by industry, agent and characteristics of the sampling strategy. The review identified nearly 60 studies that examined the within-worker and between-worker sources of variation in exposure to workplace contaminants. In pooling results across studies, the between-worker variability increased as workers were aggregated across jobs and locations. The within-worker variability for an occupational group of workers was generally larger than the between-worker variability, although the differences in the variation in exposures across work shifts relative to the variation among workers' mean exposure levels diminished as groups were combined across jobs and locations. On average, gaseous exposures were more homogeneous than exposures to aerosols or dermal agents as were exposures in the chemical industry compared with the non-chemical industry. The design of sampling strategies also plays an important role with greater variability among groups of workers who were sampled randomly rather than systematically; in addition, differences were detected on the basis of the study period and sample size. In evaluating key features of the design and methods of the studies identified in the review, several methodological issues emerged given the heterogeneity in terms of how censored data were handled, which estimation method was applied and whether underlying assumptions of the models were met. Notwithstanding the utility of quantifying sources of variation in exposure, several challenges lie ahead with regard to ensuring quality in the collection, analysis and reporting of exposure monitoring data that would enhance efforts to accurately assess exposure.},

The conceptual model is constructed using three components, i.e. (i) the source, (ii) various transmission compartments and (iii) the receptor, and describes the contaminant's emission and its pattern of transport. Based on this conceptual model, a list of nine mutually independent principal modifying factors (MFs) is proposed: activity emission potential, substance emission potential, localized control, separation, segregation, dilution, worker behavior, surface contamination and respiratory protection. These MFs describe the exposure process at a high level of abstraction so that the model can be generically applicable. A list of exposure determinants underlying each of these principal MFs is proposed to describe the exposure process at a more detailed level. The presented conceptual model is developed in conjunction with an activity taxonomy as described in a separate paper. The proposed conceptual model and MFs should be seen as 'building blocks' for development of higher tier exposure models.},

  abstract        = {This study examines the role of occupational factors in the development of diffuse malignant mesothelioma with special emphasis on the dose-response relationship for asbestos and on the exposure to man-made vitreous fibers (MMVFs). One hundred and twenty-five male cases, diagnosed by a panel of pathologists, were personally interviewed concerning their occupational and smoking history. The same number of population controls (matched for sex, age and region of residence) underwent similar interviews by trained interviewers. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for an expert-based exposure index using conditional logistic regression. Exposure to asbestos shows the expected sharp gradient with an OR of about 45 for a cumulative exposure > 1.5 fiber years (arithmetic mean 16 fiber years). A significant OR was calculated even for the lowest exposure category "> 0 - < or = 0.15 fiber years". Although the mean cumulative exposure to MMVF is roughly 10% of the exposure to asbestos, an increased OR is observed in an ever/never evaluation. This observation is heavily hampered by methodical problems. A corresponding case-control study was performed using a lung tissue fiber analysis in addition to interviews. Both interviews and the lung tissue analysis yielded similar OR levels between the reference and the maximum exposure intervals. Despite a possible influence as a result of selection and information bias, our results confirm the previously reported observation of a distinct dose-response relationship even at levels of cumulative exposure below 1 fiber year. Moreover, the study confirms that asbestos is a relevant confounder for MMVF. A causal relationship between exposure to MMVF and mesothelioma could neither be detected nor excluded, as in other studies.},

We assessed clinical and exposure characteristics, as well as possible time trends, among patients in whom AB had been quantified in BAL. BAL samples obtained from 578 participants between January 1997 and December 2014 were available for analysis. The processing of samples and the microscopic analysis were performed by a single expert and 76% of samples came from a single tertiary care hospital, allowing clinical and exposure data to be extracted from patient files. The study population (95% males) had a mean age of 62.5 (±12.4) years. AB were detected in 55.2% of the samples, giving a median concentration of 0.5 AB/mL (95th centile: 23.6 AB/mL; highest value: 164.5 AB/mL). The AB concentration exceeded 1 AB/mL in 39.4% and 5 AB/mL in 17.8%. A significant decrease from a geometric mean of 0.93 AB/mL in 1997 to 0.2 AB/mL in 2014 was apparent. High AB concentrations generally corresponded with occupations with (presumed) high asbestos exposure. AB concentrations were higher among patients with asbestosis and pleural plaques, when compared with other disease groups. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of participants with likely exposure to asbestos did not exhibit high AB counts. This retrospective study of a large clinical population supports the value of counting AB in BAL as a complementary approach to assess past exposure to asbestos.},

However, there have been few studies regarding the prognosis of patients with IPF according to patient occupation. We investigated whether occupational dust exposure was associated with clinically decreased lung function and poor prognosis. The Korean Interstitial Lung Disease Research Group conducted a national survey to evaluate the clinical, physiologic, radiologic, and survival characteristics of patients with IPF. A total of 1,311 patients with IPF were stratified into five groups according to their occupation: (1) unemployed or homemakers (n = 628); (2) farmers, fishers, or ranchers (n = 230); (3) sales or service personnel (n = 131); (4) clerical or professional personnel (n = 151); and (5) specific dust-exposed workers (n = 171). The mean age of subjects at diagnosis, was 67.5 ± 9.7 years. Current smokers were 336 patients, 435 were exsmokers, and 456 were never smokers. Dust-exposed workers showed early onset of IPF (61.3 ± 8.6 years; P < .001) and a longer duration of symptoms at diagnosis (17.0 ± 28.2 months; P = .004). Aging (P = .001; hazard ratio [HR], 1.034; 95% CI, 1.014-1.054), FVC % predicted at diagnosis (P = .004; HR, 0.984; 95% CI, 0.974-0.995), and dust-exposure occupation (P = .033; HR, 1.813; 95% CI, 1.049-3.133) were associated with mortality. These findings indicate that occupational dust may be an aggravating factor associated with a poor prognosis in IPF.},

To evaluate the risk factors for COPD besides personal cigarette smoking. We constituted an ad hoc subcommittee of the American Thoracic Society Environmental and Occupational Health Assembly. An international group of members was invited, based on their scientific expertise in a specific risk factor for COPD. For each risk factor area, the committee reviewed the literature, summarized the evidence, and developed conclusions about the likelihood of it causing COPD. All conclusions were based on unanimous consensus. The population-attributable fraction for smoking as a cause of COPD ranged from 9.7 to 97.9%, but was less than 80% in most studies, indicating a substantial burden of disease attributable to nonsmoking risk factors. On the basis of our review, we concluded that specific genetic syndromes and occupational exposures were causally related to the development of COPD. Traffic and other outdoor pollution, secondhand smoke, biomass smoke, and dietary factors are associated with COPD, but sufficient criteria for causation were not met. Chronic asthma and tuberculosis are associated with irreversible loss of lung function, but there remains uncertainty about whether there are important phenotypic differences compared with COPD as it is typically encountered in clinical settings. In public health terms, a substantive burden of COPD is attributable to risk factors other than smoking. To prevent COPD-related disability and mortality, efforts must focus on prevention and cessation of exposure to smoking and these other, less well-recognized risk factors.},

  abstract     = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause associated with the histopathologic and/or radiologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Occupational risk factors have been proposed to be associated with UIP. The aim of this case-control study is to evaluate the relationship between UIP pattern and occupational exposure in Southern Europe. Sixty nine cases with a UIP radiological pattern at CT-scan were selected from a clinical database of the University Hospital of Perugia, Umbria, between January 2010 and December 2013. Controls (n = 277) not reporting doctor diagnosed pulmonary fibrosis, were ascertained casually among general population from the same catching area of cases. Data were collected by a questionnaire used previously in a similar study. Logistic regression models, adjusted for gender, age and smoking, were performed to evaluate the association between UIP and occupational exposure. Farmers, veterinarians and gardeners (OR = 2.73, 95%CI = 1.47-5.10), metallurgical and steel industry workers (OR = 4.80, 95%CI = 1.50-15.33) were occupations associated with UIP. Metal dust and fumes and organic dust were risk factors for UIP. Increasing the length of occupational exposure in jobs at risk of pulmonary fibrosis, increased the risk of having UIP. This case control study confirm partially the results from previous similar studies. Some discrepancies could be explained by the different geographical origins of the population under study, reflecting also different occupational exposures.},

  abstract        = {Mesothelioma is closely related to exposure to asbestos, and mesothelioma mortality can be taken as an index of past exposure to asbestos in the population. We analysed mesothelioma mortality since 1968 to assess the current state of the mesothelioma epidemic, and to predict its future course. We found that rates of mesothelioma in men formed a clear pattern defined by age and date of birth. Rates rose steeply with age showing a very similar pattern in all five-year birth cohorts. By date of birth, rates increased from mid-1893 to mid-1948, and then fell. Relative to the 1943-48 cohort, the risk for the 1948-53 cohort is 0.79 and for the 1953-58 cohort 0.48. Despite these falls, if the age profile of rates for these cohorts follows the pattern of past cohorts, their predicted lifetime mesothelioma risks will be 1.3%, 1.0%, and 0.6%. Combining projections for all cohorts results in a peak of annual male mesothelioma deaths in about the year 2020 of between 2700 and 3300 deaths. If diagnostic trend is responsible for a 20% growth in recorded cases every 5 years--an extreme but arguable case--and if this trend has now ceased, the peak of annual male deaths will be reduced to 1300, reached around the year 2010. Analysis of occupations recorded on death certificates indicate that building workers, especially plumbers and gas fitters, carpenters and electricians are the largest high-risk group. These data indicate that mesothelioma deaths will continue to increase for at least 15 and more likely 25 years. For the worst affected cohorts--men born in the 1940s--mesothelioma may account for around 1% of all deaths. Asbestos exposure at work in construction and building maintenance will account for a large proportion of these deaths, and it is important that such workers should be aware of the risks and take appropriate precautions.},

Such associations are vulnerable to index event bias, by which selection of subjects according to disease status creates biased associations if common causes of incidence and prognosis are not accounted for. We propose an adjustment for index event bias using the residuals from the regression of genetic effects on prognosis on genetic effects on incidence. Our approach eliminates this bias when direct genetic effects on incidence and prognosis are independent, and otherwise reduces bias in realistic situations. In a study of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, we reverse a paradoxical association of the strong susceptibility gene MUC5B with increased survival, suggesting instead a significant association with decreased survival. In re-analysis of a study of Crohn's disease prognosis, four regions remain associated at genome-wide significance but with increased standard errors.},

As such, animals have evolved strategies to combat infection at these sites, in particular the production of mucus to prevent attachment and to promote subsequent movement of the mucus/microbe away from the underlying epithelial surface. Using biochemical, biophysical, and infection studies, we have investigated the host protective properties of the skin mucus barrier of the   tadpole. Specifically, we have characterized the major structural component of the barrier and shown that it is a mucin glycoprotein (Otogelin-like or Otogl) with similar sequence, domain organization, and structural properties to human gel-forming mucins. This mucin forms the structural basis of a surface barrier (∼6 μm thick), which is depleted through knockdown of Otogl. Crucially, Otogl knockdown leads to susceptibility to infection by the opportunistic pathogen   To more accurately reflect its structure, tissue localization, and function, we have renamed Otogl as   Skin Mucin, or MucXS. Our findings characterize an accessible and tractable model system to define mucus barrier function and host-microbe interactions.},

This allele was strongly associated with increased MUC5B gene expression in lung tissue from unaffected subjects. Despite the strong association of this airway epithelial marker with disease, little is known of mucin expressing structures or of airway involvement in IPF/UIP. Immunofluorescence was used to subtype mucus cells according to MUC5B and MUC5AC expression and to identify ciliated, basal, and alveolar type II (ATII) cells in tissue sections from control and IPF/UIP subjects. Staining patterns were quantified for distal airways (Control and IPF/UIP) and in honeycomb cysts (HC). MUC5B-expressing cells (EC) were detected in the majority of control distal airways. MUC5AC-EC were identified in half of these airways and only in airways that contained MUC5B-EC. The frequency of MUC5B+ and MUC5AC+ distal airways was increased in IPF/UIP subjects. MUC5B-EC were the dominant mucus cell type in the HC epithelium. The distal airway epithelium from control and IPF/UIP subjects and HC was populated by basal and ciliated cells. Most honeycombing regions were distinct from ATII hyperplasic regions. ATII cells were undetectable in the overwhelming majority of HC. The distal airway contains a pseudostratified mucocilary epithelium that is defined by basal epithelial cells and mucus cells that express MUC5B predominantly. These data suggest that the HC is derived from the distal airway.},

They are heavily glycosylated with O-linked glycans that are involved in myriad cellular functions, including protection from external changes in pH, ion flux and reactive oxygen species. Aberrations in mucin expression and their glycan constitution have been associated with many disease states including gastritis, pulmonary disorders and cancer. High resolution structural information on mucins is lacking due to their complexity, in particular their large size and the many variants of O-linked glycans produced in their biosynthesis. This review discusses the structures of glycopeptides that contain "mucin-type" glycosylation, and concentrates primarily on data obtained by NMR spectroscopy. The effect of the glycan on the peptide backbone, the features that have shown to be common to this type of glycosylation and the differences of glycosylation at serine and threonine residues are the major topics of discussion.},

Alveolar epithelial injury consisted of patchy necrosis and regenerative hyperplasia. Alveolar capillary injury consisted of cytoplasmic swelling and basement membrane thickening and reduplication. Many of these features have not been emphasized in previous reports and their prominence in early stages of the disease suggest that they may have pathogenetic significance, possible mechanisms of which are discussed.

Likewise, the transcriptional signatures of most of them are unknown. To compare the gene expression patterns from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) using custom oligonucleotide microarrays. We profiled lung biopsies from 15 patients with IPF, 12 with HP, and eight with NSIP. Labeled complementary ribonucleic acid was hybridized to a custom Affymetrix oligonucleotide DNA microarray using standard Affymetrix protocols. The custom array, Hu03, contained 59,619 probe sets representing an estimated 46,000 gene clusters. We identified statistically significant gene expression signatures that characterize HP and IPF. The HP gene expression signature was enriched for genes that are functionally associated with inflammation, T-cell activation, and immune responses, whereas the IPF signature was characterized by the expression of tissue remodeling, epithelial, and myofibroblast genes. We then compared these gene expression signatures to classify NSIP, a histologic pattern that is often difficult to differentiate consistently from HP and IPF. Two cases exhibited an IPF-like gene expression, another one could be more properly classified as HP, whereas others did not resemble HP or IPF, suggesting that they may represent idiopathic NSIP. Our results underscore the value of gene expression signatures to classify the interstitial lung diseases and to understand pathogenic mechanisms, and suggest new ways to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with these diseases.},

Here, we identify a critical regulatory domain that contains the MUC5B promoter variant and has a highly conserved forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) binding motif. This region is differentially methylated in association with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, MUC5B expression, and rs35705950. In addition, we show that this locus binds FOXA2 dynamically, and that binding of FOXA2 is necessary for enhanced expression of MUC5B. In aggregate, our findings identify novel targets to regulate the expression of MUC5B.},

  abstract        = {Exocytosis of secreted mucins is the final step in their intracellular processing, resulting in their release into the airway lumen to interact with water and ions to form mucus. Mucins are secreted at a low baseline rate and a high stimulated rate, and both rates are regulated by second messengers acting on components of the exocytic machinery. The principal physiologic function of the low baseline rate is to support steady-state mucociliary clearance of inhaled particles and pathogens that enter the airways during normal breathing. Even in the setting of mucin hyperproduction, baseline secretion generally does not induce mucus occlusion. The principal physiologic function of the high stimulated rate of secretion from both submucosal glands and surface goblet cells in proximal airways appears to be to sweep away larger particles, whereas in distal airways it appears to act in concert with mucin hyperproduction to induce mucus occlusion to trap migrating helminths. Pathophysiologically, stimulated mucin secretion in the setting of mucin hyperproduction from allergic or other types of airway inflammation in the absence of helminth infection causes airflow obstruction and infection. Molecular components of the mucin exocytic machinery are increasingly being identified, and surprisingly, many components are not shared between baseline and stimulated machines. The physiologic significance of the presence of two distinct molecular machines is not yet known, such as whether these interact selectively with secretory granules of different sizes or contents. A full understanding of the mechanism and regulation of airway mucin secretion will provide further insight into pathophysiologic processes and may identify therapeutic strategies to alleviate obstructive airway diseases.},

We have previously found that 1) a common gain-of-function promoter variant in MUC5B rs35705950 is the strongest risk factor (genetic and otherwise), accounting for 30-35% of the risk of developing IPF, a disease that was previously considered idiopathic; 2) the MUC5B promoter variant can potentially be used to identify individuals with preclinical pulmonary fibrosis and is predictive of radiologic progression of preclinical pulmonary fibrosis; and 3) MUC5B may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis with MUC5B message and protein expressed in bronchiolo-alveolar epithelia of IPF and the characteristic IPF honeycomb cysts. Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that excessive production of MUC5B either enhances injury due to reduced mucociliary clearance or impedes repair consequent to disruption of normal regenerative mechanisms in the distal lung. In aggregate, these novel considerations should have broad impact, resulting in specific etiologic targets, early detection of disease, and novel biologic pathways for use in the design of future intervention, prevention, and mechanistic studies of IPF.},

Pathologically, both pulmonary fibrosis of a particular pattern and evidence of excess asbestos in the lungs must be present.

However, there are differences between the 2 diseases apart from the presence or absence of asbestos. First, the interstitial fibrosis of asbestosis is accompanied by very little inflammation, which, although not marked, is better developed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Second, in keeping with the slow tempo of the disease, the fibroblastic foci that characterize idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are infrequent in asbestosis. Third, asbestosis is almost always accompanied by mild fibrosis of the visceral pleura, a feature that is rare in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.RESPIRATORY BRONCHIOLITIS: Asbestosis is believed to start in the region of the respiratory bronchiole and gradually extends outward to involve more and more of the lung acinus, until the separate foci of fibrosis link, resulting in the characteristically diffuse pattern of the disease. These early stages of the disease are diagnostically problematic because similar centriacinar fibrosis is often seen in cigarette smokers and is characteristic of mixed-dust pneumoconiosis.

  abstract        = {Microscopic techniques for analysing asbestos fibres in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage have provided major information in the understanding of asbestos-related diseases. These analyses are increasingly applied for clinical work and medicolegal problems. Differences in sampling, preparation and counting techniques, definitions of reference populations and expression of results have caused major difficulties in comparing results from different laboratories. Therefore it appeared necessary to set a goal to harmonize these analyses between the European laboratories active in this field. This article summarizes the work of a European Respiratory Society working group with participation from nine European laboratories. The five main issues touched upon are: 1) definitions of control populations and reference levels; 2) sampling, preparation and analytical techniques; 3) asbestos fibres in lung tissues in different pathologies; 4) asbestos bodies in lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum; and 5) basis for the interpretation of fibres and asbestos bodies in biological samples. These guidelines indicate the crucial importance of several factors for the interpretation of the results; namely, adequate sampling, comparable analytical procedures and expression of the results, the use of well-defined reference populations, and a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting the fibre retention and the dose-responses associated with the different asbestos-related diseases.},

  abstract        = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is localized to the lung, is characterized by a pattern of heterogeneous, subpleural patches of fibrotic, remodeled lung, and is associated with a median survival of 3-5 years after diagnosis. A common gain-of-function MUC5B promoter variant, rs35705950, is the strongest risk factor (genetic and otherwise), accounting for at least 30% of the total risk of developing IPF. The MUC5B promoter variant can be used to identify individuals in the preclinical phase of this progressive disease, and, in the IPF lung, we have found that MUC5B is specifically overexpressed in bronchoalveolar epithelium. Thus, MUC5B represents a key molecule to understand the mechanisms that appear to initiate the fibroproliferative process in the bronchoalveolar epithelium. Moreover, focusing on MUC5B may provide a unique opportunity to define the early molecular events that lead to, and potentially prevent, the development of IPF.},

The recent resurgent interest in macrophage biology has led to a new understanding of lung macrophage origins, biology, and phenotypes. In this review we discuss fibrotic mechanisms and focus on the role of macrophages during fibrotic lung disease. Data from both human and murine studies are reviewed, highlighting novel macrophage-orientated biomarkers for disease diagnosis and potential targets for future anti-fibrotic therapies.},

  abstract        = {Lung epithelial cells are increasingly recognized to be active effectors of microbial defense, contributing to both innate and adaptive immune function in the lower respiratory tract. As immune sentinels, lung epithelial cells detect diverse pathogens through an ample repertoire of membrane-bound, endosomal, and cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). The highly plastic epithelial barrier responds to detected threats via modulation of paracellular flux, intercellular communications, mucin production, and periciliary fluid composition. Epithelial PRR stimulation also induces production of cytokines that recruit and sculpt leukocyte-mediated responses, and promotes epithelial generation of antimicrobial effector molecules that are directly microbicidal. The epithelium can alternately enhance tolerance to pathogens, preventing tissue damage through PRR-induced inhibitory signals, opsonization of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and attenuation of injurious leukocyte responses. The inducibility of these protective responses has prompted attempts to therapeutically harness epithelial defense mechanisms to protect against pneumonias. Recent reports describe successful strategies for manipulation of epithelial defenses to protect against a wide range of respiratory pathogens. The lung epithelium is capable of both significant antimicrobial responses that reduce pathogen burdens and tolerance mechanisms that attenuate immunopathology. This manuscript reviews inducible lung epithelial defense mechanisms that offer opportunities for therapeutic manipulation to protect vulnerable populations against pneumonia.},

  abstract        = {Asbestosis is an inflammatory and fibrotic process of the alveolar structures mediated, at least in part, by cytokines released by "activated" alveolar macrophages. The process of phagocytosis and "activation" of alveolar macrophages is poorly understood. Are all macrophages activated or only subpopulations? Which cytokines are up-regulated? How does the local milieu modulate profibrotic and antifibrotic mediators? Is protein release accompanied by up-regulation of gene transcription? Is there an ordered sequence of cytokine activity? What roles do neutrophils and lymphocytes play? How can disease progression best be quantified absent further exposure? Answers to these questions are important to direct rational strategies at interdicting the fibrotic process. The question of cancer and asbestos is more vexing. The processes of inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis appear to be closely intertwined. For example, proto-oncogenes such as c-sis (PDGF B-chain) are up-regulated in activated alveolar macrophages from fibrotic lungs; these and possibly others may play an important role in asbestos carcinogenesis. Second, asbestos can transfect DNA into cells. Furthermore, DNA can adhere to asbestos fibers, and these fibers are capable of direct transmigration into cells. The questions of the mechanisms of cigarette smoke cocarcinogenicity and latency remain. Lastly, if the bronchial epithelium is highly metaplastic throughout from cigarette smoking, what triggers a single (or several) nidus of cells to transform into carcinoma? Malignant mesothelioma poses the most challenging questions because of association with brief asbestos exposure by history. Mesothelial cells are susceptible to minute environmental manipulations, and changes occur after exposure to all fiber types. Yet epidemiologic studies point toward long amphiboles as having greater mesothelioma risk. To test this hypothesis, experimental data must be generated differentiating tumorigenesis risk from short, chrysotile fibers that can migrate to the parietal pleura from the associations of long amphiboles persisting in lung tissue. Despite the future decreasing numbers of clinical cases of asbestos-related disease, solving the important mechanistic questions remaining will contribute significantly to our understanding of fibrosis and cancer.},

Overt respiratory infection and immunosuppression carry a high morbidity and mortality, and polymorphisms in genes related to epithelial integrity and host defense predispose to IPF. To investigate the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis and progression of IPF. We prospectively enrolled patients diagnosed with IPF according to international criteria together with healthy smokers, nonsmokers, and subjects with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as control subjects. Subjects underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from which genomic DNA was isolated. The V3-V5 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified, allowing quantification of bacterial load and identification of communities by 16S rRNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing. Sixty-five patients with IPF had double the burden of bacteria in BAL fluid compared with 44 control subjects. Baseline bacterial burden predicted the rate of decline in lung volume and risk of death and associated independently with the rs35705950 polymorphism of the MUC5B mucin gene, a proven host susceptibility factor for IPF. Sequencing yielded 912,883 high-quality reads from all subjects. We identified Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Veillonella spp. to be more abundant in cases than control subjects. Regression analyses indicated that these specific operational taxonomic units as well as bacterial burden associated independently with IPF. IPF is characterized by an increased bacterial burden in BAL that predicts decline in lung function and death. Trials of antimicrobial therapy are needed to determine if microbial burden is pathogenic in the disease.},

In mice, we demonstrate that Muc5b concentration in bronchoalveolar epithelia is related to impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) and to the extent and persistence of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. We also establish the ability of the mucolytic agent P-2119 to restore MCC and to suppress bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in the setting of Muc5b overexpression. Our findings suggest that mucociliary dysfunction might play a causative role in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice overexpressing Muc5b, and that MUC5B in distal airspaces is a potential therapeutic target in humans with IPF.},

This accumulation of scar tissue limits gas exchange causing respiratory insufficiency. The pathogenesis of lung fibrosis is poorly understood, but immunologic-based treatments have been largely ineffective. Despite this, accumulating evidence suggests that innate immune cells and receptors play important modulatory roles in the initiation and propagation of the disease. Paradoxically, while innate immune signalling may be important for the pathogenesis of fibrosis, there is also evidence to suggest that innate immune function against pathogens may be impaired, leading to dysregulated and/or impaired host defence.

  abstract        = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal condition with limited treatment options. However, in a previous small study, co-trimoxazole was found to be beneficial. In a double-blind multicentre study, 181 patients with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (89% diagnosed as definite/probable IPF) were randomised to receive co-trimoxazole 960 mg twice daily or placebo for 12 months in addition to usual care. Measurements were made of forced vital capacity (FVC) (primary endpoint), diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (Dlco) and EuroQol (EQ5D)-based utility, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea score (secondary endpoints). All-cause mortality and adverse events were recorded (tertiary endpoints). Co-trimoxazole had no effect on FVC (mean difference 15.5 ml (95% CI -93.6 to 124.6)), Dlco (mean difference -0.12 mmol/min/kPa (95% CI 0.41 to 0.17)), 6MWT or MRC dyspnoea score (intention-to-treat analysis). The findings of the per-protocol analysis were the same except that co-trimoxazole treatment resulted in a significant improvement in EQ5D-based utility (mean difference 0.12 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.22)), a reduction in the percentage of patients requiring an increase in oxygen therapy (OR 0.05 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.61)) and a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (co-trimoxazole 3/53, placebo 14/65, HR 0.21 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.78), p=0.02)) compared with placebo. The use of co-trimoxazole reduced respiratory tract infections but increased the incidence of nausea and rash. The addition of co-trimoxazole therapy to standard treatment for fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia had no effect on lung function but resulted in improved quality of life and a reduction in mortality in those adhering to treatment.

  abstract        = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) causes considerable global morbidity and mortality, and its mechanisms of disease progression are poorly understood. Recent observational studies have reported associations between lung dysbiosis, mortality, and altered host defense gene expression, supporting a role for lung microbiota in IPF. However, the causal significance of altered lung microbiota in disease progression is undetermined.   To examine the effect of microbiota on local alveolar inflammation and disease progression using both animal models and human subjects with IPF.   For human studies, we characterized lung microbiota in BAL fluid from 68 patients with IPF. For animal modeling, we used a murine model of pulmonary fibrosis in conventional and germ-free mice. Lung bacteria were characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing with novel techniques optimized for low-biomass sample load. Microbiota were correlated with alveolar inflammation, measures of pulmonary fibrosis, and disease progression.   Disruption of the lung microbiome predicts disease progression, correlates with local host inflammation, and participates in disease progression. In patients with IPF, lung bacterial burden predicts fibrosis progression, and microbiota diversity and composition correlate with increased alveolar profibrotic cytokines. In murine models of fibrosis, lung dysbiosis precedes peak lung injury and is persistent. In germ-free animals, the absence of a microbiome protects against mortality.   Our results demonstrate that lung microbiota contribute to the progression of IPF. We provide biological plausibility for the hypothesis that lung dysbiosis promotes alveolar inflammation and aberrant repair. Manipulation of lung microbiota may represent a novel target for the treatment of IPF.},

  abstract        = {The concept of the inflammasome, a macromolecular complex sensing cell stress or danger signals and initiating inflammation, was first introduced approximately a decade ago. Priming and activation of these intracellular protein platforms trigger the maturation of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, most notably, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, to promulgate innate immune defenses. Although classically studied in models of gout, Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis, the importance and mechanisms of action of inflammasome priming and activation have recently been elucidated in cells of the respiratory tract where they modulate the responses to a number of inhaled pathogenic particles and fibres. Most notably, inflammasome activation appears to regulate the balance between tissue repair and inflammation after inhalation of pathogenic pollutants such as asbestos, crystalline silica (CS), and airborne particulate matter (PM). Different types of fibres and particles may have distinct mechanisms of inflammasome interaction and outcome. This review summarizes the structure and function of inflammasomes, the interplay between various chemokines and cytokines and cell types of the lung and pleura after inflammasome activation, and the events leading to the development of non-malignant (allergic airway disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asbestosis, silicosis) and malignant (mesothelioma, lung cancer) diseases by pathogenic particulates. In addition, it emphasizes the importance of communication between cells of the immune system, target cells of these diseases, and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in regulation of inflammasome-mediated events.},

Recent developments in this field demonstrate the crucial role of the inflammasome in a wide range of disease models. Although inflammasomes are a crucial part of host defense mechanisms against pathogens, the exuberant immune response resulting from inflammasome activation also contributes to the development of various diseases. As ongoing studies further elucidate the regulation and function of the inflammasome, more evidence has emerged that the inflammasome appears to play a pivotal role in the development of multiple inflammatory diseases. Here, we discuss recent insights into how inflammasomes are regulated to activate caspase-1 and implicated in human diseases. We also review the contributions of the inflammasome to pulmonary diseases.},

Recent studies demonstrate a role for the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine rich repeat containing family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and its regulated cytokines in experimental lung fibrosis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that age-related NLRP3 inflammasome activation is an important predisposing factor in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Briefly, young and aged wild-type and NLRP3(-/-) mice were subjected to bleomycin-induced lung injury. Pulmonary fibrosis was determined by histology and hydroxyproline accumulation. Bone marrow and alveolar macrophages were isolated from these mice. NLRP3 inflammasome activation was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. IL-1β and IL-18 production was measured by ELISA. The current study demonstrated that aged wild-type mice developed more lung fibrosis and exhibited increased morbidity and mortality after bleomycin-induced lung injury, when compared with young mice. Bleomycin-exposed aged NLRP3(-/-) mice had reduced fibrosis compared with their wild-type age-matched counterparts. Bone marrow-derived and alveolar macrophages from aged mice displayed higher levels of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and caspase-1-dependent IL-1β and IL-18 production, which was associated with altered mitochondrial function and increased production of reactive oxygen species. Our study demonstrated that age-dependent increases in alveolar macrophage mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation contribute to the development of experimental fibrosis.},

  abstract     = {Mucus layers often provide a unique and multi-functional hydrogel interface between the epithelial cells of organisms and their external environment. Mucus has exceptional properties including elasticity, changeable rheology and an ability to self-repair by re-annealing, and is therefore an ideal medium for trapping and immobilising pathogens and serving as a barrier to microbial infection. The ability to produce a functional surface mucosa was an important evolutionary step, which evolved first in the Cnidaria, which includes corals, and the Ctenophora. This allowed the exclusion of non-commensal microbes and the subsequent development of the mucus-lined digestive cavity seen in higher metazoans. The fundamental architecture of the constituent glycoprotein mucins is also evolutionarily conserved. Although an understanding of the biochemical interactions between bacteria and the mucus layer are important to the goal of developing new antimicrobial strategies, they remain relatively poorly understood. This review summarises the physicochemical properties and evolutionary importance of mucus, which make it so successful in the prevention of bacterial infection. In addition, the strategies developed by bacteria to counteract the mucus layer are also explored.},

Recent data indicate important roles for genomics in the mechanisms underlying susceptibility and progression of pulmonary fibrosis. The impact of these genomic markers on pharmacotherapy and their contribution to outcomes is increasingly recognized. Interstitial lung abnormalities, frequently considered representative of early ILD, have been consistently associated with the MUC5B promoter polymorphism, a common gene variant. Other rare gene variant mutations, including TERT, TERC, SFTPC, and DKC1, may be present in patients with familial interstitial pneumonia and are frequently associated with a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern of fibrosis. The minor allele of the MUC5B rs35705950 genotype is prevalent in several sporadic forms of ILD, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Gene mutations that characterize familial pulmonary fibrosis may be present in patients with connective tissue disease-related ILD, such as rheumatoid arthritis-ILD. Additionally, shorter telomere lengths and mutations in telomere biology-related genes have been demonstrated in both familial and sporadic ILD, with significant implications for disease progression, lung function, and survival. An improved understanding of the impact of genetic and genomic risk factors on disease progression would better guide personalized therapeutic choices in persons with fibrotic ILD.},

In the present study, we investigated possible genetic associations between three single nucleotide polymorphisms in MUC5B promoter region and CWP in a case-control study including 686 CWP patients and 680 controls. Genotyping was carried out by TaqMan method. Only rs2672794 allele and genotype frequencies distributions were significantly different between CWP patients and controls (P = 0.017 and 0.046 for allele and genotype, respectively). The MUC5B rs2672794 CC genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of CWP, compared with the TT genotype. Moreover, individuals with TC/CC genotype had an obviously increased risk of CWP than those with TT genotype, particularly among subgroups of dust exposure <27 years and smokers. This is the first report showing an association between the MUC5B rs2672794 polymorphism and CWP, and our results suggest that MUC5B rs2672794 CC genotype could increase the risk of CWP.

  abstract        = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic bronchitic and emphysematous components. In one biophysical model, the concentration of mucin on the airway surfaces is hypothesized to be a key variable that controls mucus transport in healthy persons versus cessation of transport in persons with muco-obstructive lung diseases. Under this model, it is postulated that a high mucin concentration produces the sputum and disease progression that are characteristic of chronic bronchitis. We characterized the COPD status of 917 participants from the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) using questionnaires administered to participants, chest tomography, spirometry, and examination of induced sputum. Total mucin concentrations in sputum were measured with the use of size-exclusion chromatography and refractometry. In 148 of these participants, the respiratory secreted mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B were quantitated by means of mass spectrometry. Data from chronic-bronchitis questionnaires and data on total mucin concentrations in sputum were also analyzed in an independent 94-participant cohort. Mean (±SE) total mucin concentrations were higher in current or former smokers with severe COPD than in controls who had never smoked (3166±402 vs. 1515±152 μg per milliliter) and were higher in participants with two or more respiratory exacerbations per year than in those with zero exacerbations (4194±878 vs. 2458±113 μg per milliliter). The absolute concentrations of MUC5B and MUC5AC in current or former smokers with severe COPD were approximately 3 times as high and 10 times as high, respectively, as in controls who had never smoked. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis of the association between total mucin concentration and a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis yielded areas under the curve of 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.79) for the SPIROMICS cohort and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.92) for the independent cohort. Airway mucin concentrations may quantitate a key component of the chronic bronchitis pathophysiologic cascade that produces sputum and mediates disease severity. Studies designed to explore total mucin concentrations in sputum as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for chronic bronchitis appear to be warranted.

  abstract        = {Owing to the need to balance the requirement for efficient respiration in the face of tremendous levels of exposure to endogenous and environmental challenges, it is crucial for the lungs to maintain a sustainable defence that minimises damage caused by this exposure and the detrimental effects of inflammation to delicate gas exchange surfaces. Accordingly, epithelial and macrophage defences constitute essential first and second lines of protection that prevent the accumulation of potentially harmful agents in the lungs, and under homeostatic conditions do so effectively without inducing inflammation. Though epithelial and macrophage-mediated defences are seemingly distinct, recent data show that they are linked through their shared reliance on airway mucins, in particular the polymeric mucin MUC5B. This review highlights our understanding of novel mechanisms that link mucus and macrophage defences. We discuss the roles of phagocytosis and the effects of factors contained within mucus on phagocytosis, as well as newly identified roles for mucin glycoproteins in the direct regulation of leukocyte functions. The emergence of this nascent field of glycoimmunobiology sets forth a new paradigm for considering how homeostasis is maintained under healthy conditions and how it is restored in disease.},

  abstract        = {Respiratory surfaces are exposed to billions of particulates and pathogens daily. A protective mucus barrier traps and eliminates them through mucociliary clearance (MCC). However, excessive mucus contributes to transient respiratory infections and to the pathogenesis of numerous respiratory diseases. MUC5AC and MUC5B are evolutionarily conserved genes that encode structurally related mucin glycoproteins, the principal macromolecules in airway mucus. Genetic variants are linked to diverse lung diseases, but specific roles for MUC5AC and MUC5B in MCC, and the lasting effects of their inhibition, are unknown. Here we show that mouse Muc5b (but not Muc5ac) is required for MCC, for controlling infections in the airways and middle ear, and for maintaining immune homeostasis in mouse lungs, whereas Muc5ac is dispensable. Muc5b deficiency caused materials to accumulate in upper and lower airways. This defect led to chronic infection by multiple bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, and to inflammation that failed to resolve normally. Apoptotic macrophages accumulated, phagocytosis was impaired, and interleukin-23 (IL-23) production was reduced in Muc5b(-/-) mice. By contrast, in mice that transgenically overexpress Muc5b, macrophage functions improved. Existing dogma defines mucous phenotypes in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as driven by increased MUC5AC, with MUC5B levels either unaffected or increased in expectorated sputum. However, in many patients, MUC5B production at airway surfaces decreases by as much as 90%. By distinguishing a specific role for Muc5b in MCC, and by determining its impact on bacterial infections and inflammation in mice, our results provide a refined framework for designing targeted therapies to control mucin secretion and restore MCC.},

Here, we report that alterations in lung microbiota critically promote pulmonary fibrosis pathogenesis. We found that lung microbiota was dysregulated, and the dysregulated microbiota in turn induced production of interleukin-17B (IL-17B) during bleomycin-induced mouse lung fibrosis. Either lung-microbiota depletion or IL-17B deficiency ameliorated the disease progression. IL-17B cooperated with tumor necrosis factor-α to induce expression of neutrophil-recruiting genes and T helper 17 (Th17)-cell-promoting genes. Three pulmonary commensal microbes, which belong to the genera Bacteroides and Prevotella, were identified to promote fibrotic pathogenesis through IL-17R signaling. We further defined that the outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that were derived from the identified commensal microbes induced IL-17B production through Toll-like receptor-Myd88 adaptor signaling. Together our data demonstrate that specific pulmonary symbiotic commensals can promote lung fibrosis by regulating a profibrotic inflammatory cytokine network.},

IL-1β and IL-18 levels were significantly elevated in the BALF and BALF macrophage cultures from RA-UIP patients, consistent with pre-existing inflammasome activation in these patients. In contrast, in IPF, BALF levels of IL-1β were significantly less elevated relative to RA-UIP and IL-18 was lower than controls. Furthermore, upon inflammasome stimulation, IPF BALF macrophage cultures failed to upregulate IL-1β and partly IL-18 secretion, in contrast to controls, which showed robust IL-1β and IL-18 upregulation. Interestingly, RA-UIP BALF cell cultures treated with lipopolysaccharide/ATP showed a potent stimulation of IL-18 secretion but not IL-1β, the latter being already elevated in the unstimulated cultures, while examination of the intracellular IL-1β levels in RA-UIP BALF cells upon NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation showed a significant upregulation of IL-1β suggesting the NLRP3 pathway could be further activated.Taken together, our results suggest distinct inflammasome activation profiles between autoimmune and idiopathic lung fibrosis. },

  abstract        = { Workplace inhalational hazards remain common worldwide, even though they are ameliorable. Previous American Thoracic Society documents have assessed the contribution of workplace exposures to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on a population level, but not to other chronic respiratory diseases. The goal of this document is to report an in-depth literature review and data synthesis of the occupational contribution to the burden of the major nonmalignant respiratory diseases, including airway diseases; interstitial fibrosis; hypersensitivity pneumonitis; other noninfectious granulomatous lung diseases, including sarcoidosis; and selected respiratory infections.   Relevant literature was identified for each respiratory condition. The occupational population attributable fraction (PAF) was estimated for those conditions for which there were sufficient population-based studies to allow pooled estimates. For the other conditions, the occupational burden of disease was estimated on the basis of attribution in case series, incidence rate ratios, or attributable fraction within an exposed group.   Workplace exposures contribute substantially to the burden of multiple chronic respiratory diseases, including asthma (PAF, 16%); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PAF, 14%); chronic bronchitis (PAF, 13%); idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (PAF, 26%); hypersensitivity pneumonitis (occupational burden, 19%); other granulomatous diseases, including sarcoidosis (occupational burden, 30%); pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (occupational burden, 29%); tuberculosis (occupational burden, 2.3% in silica-exposed workers and 1% in healthcare workers); and community-acquired pneumonia in working-age adults (PAF, 10%).   Workplace exposures contribute to the burden of disease across a range of nonmalignant lung conditions in adults (in addition to the 100% burden for the classic occupational pneumoconioses). This burden has important clinical, research, and policy implications. There is a pressing need to improve clinical recognition and public health awareness of the contribution of occupational factors across a range of nonmalignant respiratory diseases.},

It is not known whether this polymorphism is associated with interstitial lung disease in the general population.We performed a blinded assessment of interstitial lung abnormalities detected in 2633 participants in the Framingham Heart Study by means of volumetric chest computed tomography (CT). We evaluated the relationship between the abnormalities and the genotype at the rs35705950 locus.Of the 2633 chest CT scans that were evaluated, interstitial lung abnormalities were present in 177 (7\%). Participants with such abnormalities were more likely to have shortness of breath and chronic cough and reduced measures of total lung and diffusion capacity, as compared with participants without such abnormalities. After adjustment for covariates, for each copy of the minor rs35705950 allele, the odds of interstitial lung abnormalities were 2.8 times greater (95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 3.9; P<0.001), and the odds of definite CT evidence of pulmonary fibrosis were 6.3 times greater (95\% CI, 3.1 to 12.7; P<0.001). Although the evidence of an association between the MUC5B genotype and interstitial lung abnormalities was greater among participants who were older than 50 years of age, a history of cigarette smoking did not appear to influence the association.The MUC5B promoter polymorphism was found to be associated with interstitial lung disease in the general population. Although this association was more apparent in older persons, it did not appear to be influenced by cigarette smoking.

  abstract    = {Asbestosis is defined as diffuse pulmonary fibrosis caused by the inhalation of excessive amounts of asbestos fibers. Pathologically, both pulmonary fibrosis of a particular pattern and evidence of excess asbestos in the lungs must be present. Clinically, the disease usually progresses slowly, with a typical latent period of more than 20 years from first exposure to onset of symptoms.IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS: The pulmonary fibrosis of asbestosis is interstitial and has a basal subpleural distribution, similar to that seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which is the principal differential diagnosis. However, there are differences between the 2 diseases apart from the presence or absence of asbestos. First, the interstitial fibrosis of asbestosis is accompanied by very little inflammation, which, although not marked, is better developed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Second, in keeping with the slow tempo of the disease, the fibroblastic foci that characterize idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are infrequent in asbestosis. Third, asbestosis is almost always accompanied by mild fibrosis of the visceral pleura, a feature that is rare in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.RESPIRATORY BRONCHIOLITIS: Asbestosis is believed to start in the region of the respiratory bronchiole and gradually extends outward to involve more and more of the lung acinus, until the separate foci of fibrosis link, resulting in the characteristically diffuse pattern of the disease. These early stages of the disease are diagnostically problematic because similar centriacinar fibrosis is often seen in cigarette smokers and is characteristic of mixed-dust pneumoconiosis. Fibrosis limited to the walls of the bronchioles does not represent asbestosis.Histologic evidence of asbestos inhalation is provided by the identification of asbestos bodies either lying freely in the air spaces or embedded in the interstitial fibrosis. Asbestos bodies are distinguished from other ferruginous bodies by their thin, transparent core. Two or more asbestos bodies per square centimeter of a 5- mu m-thick lung section, in combination with interstitial fibrosis of the appropriate pattern, are indicative of asbestosis. Fewer asbestos bodies do not necessarily exclude a diagnosis of asbestosis, but evidence of excess asbestos would then require quantitative studies performed on lung digests.Quantification of asbestos load may be performed on lung digests or bronchoalveolar lavage material, employing either light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, or transmission electron microscopy. Whichever technique is employed, the results are only dependable if the laboratory is well practiced in the method chosen, frequently performs such analyses, and the results are compared with those obtained by the same laboratory applying the same technique to a control population.},
  comment     = {An important differential diagnosis that arises in cases of asbestosis?especially when there is clinical-radiologic controversy about the diagnosis?is determining whether the disorder represents asbestosis or another interstitial disorder, such as one of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, especially UIP. One point of distinction is that UIP tends to be more rapidly progressive than asbestosis, which is usually either static or only slowly progressive,69 although cases of rapidly progressive asbestosis do occur.72 About 50% or fewer cases progress after cessation of asbestos exposure.67 Clinical asbestosis can be induced by cumulative asbestos exposure amounting to an estimated 25 fibers/ ml?yrs,31,67 and Browne73 and Churg74 have indicated that a ??dose?? in the range of 25 to 100 fibers/ml?yrs is required for the development of asbestosis. One Chinese study,75 based on chest radiographs of workers involved in the manufacture of asbestos products, found a 1% prevalence of grade I asbestosis (according to the Chinese system of grading), at a cumulative exposure of 22 fibers/ml?yrs. Green et al,76 in an autopsy study on the South Carolina asbestos textile workers, reported that histologic asbesto- sis was usually detectable with exposures in excess of 20 fibers/ml?yrs, and a few cases were found with estimated cumulative exposures of 10?20 fibers/ml?yrs (histologic examination being the most sensitive and specific means for the diagnosis of asbestosis). From an analysis of cases in the German Mesothelioma Register, Fischer et al77 reported that a requirement for asbestos exposure amounting to 25 fibers/ml?yrs for the diagnosis of asbestosis?including minimal histologic asbestosis? would lead to underrecognition of 42% of asbestosis cases and false-positive diagnoses in 24%.

  abstract    = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease that probably involves several genetic loci. Several rare genetic variants and one common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of MUC5B have been associated with the disease. Our aim was to identify additional common variants associated with susceptibility and ultimately mortality in IPF.First, we did a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS): stage one was a discovery GWAS; and stages two and three were independent case-control studies. DNA samples from European-American patients with IPF meeting standard criteria were obtained from several US centres for each stage. Data for European-American control individuals for stage one were gathered from the database of genotypes and phenotypes; additional control individuals were recruited at the University of Pittsburgh to increase the number. For controls in stages two and three, we gathered data for additional sex-matched European-American control individuals who had been recruited in another study. DNA samples from patients and from control individuals were genotyped to identify SNPs associated with IPF. SNPs identified in stage one were carried forward to stage two, and those that achieved genome-wide significance (p<5?×?10(-8)) in a meta-analysis were carried forward to stage three. Three case series with follow-up data were selected from stages one and two of the GWAS using samples with follow-up data. Mortality analyses were done in these case series to assess the SNPs associated with IPF that had achieved genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis of stages one and two. Finally, we obtained gene-expression profiling data for lungs of patients with IPF from the Lung Genomics Research Consortium and analysed correlation with SNP genotypes.In stage one of the GWAS (542 patients with IPF, 542 control individuals matched one-by-one to cases by genetic ancestry estimates), we identified 20 loci. Six SNPs reached genome-wide significance in stage two (544 patients, 687 control individuals): three TOLLIP SNPs (rs111521887, rs5743894, rs5743890) and one MUC5B SNP (rs35705950) at 11p15.5; one MDGA2 SNP (rs7144383) at 14q21.3; and one SPPL2C SNP (rs17690703) at 17q21.31. Stage three (324 patients, 702 control individuals) confirmed the associations for all these SNPs, except for rs7144383. Linkage disequilibrium between the MUC5B SNP (rs35705950) and TOLLIP SNPs (rs111521887 [r(2)=0·07], rs5743894 [r(2)=0·16], and rs5743890 [r(2)=0·01]) was low. 683 patients from the GWAS were included in the mortality analysis. Individuals who developed IPF despite having the protective TOLLIP minor allele of rs5743890 carried an increased mortality risk (meta-analysis with fixed-effect model: hazard ratio 1·72 [95\% CI 1·24-2·38]; p=0·0012). TOLLIP expression was decreased by 20\% in individuals carrying the minor allele of rs5743890 (p=0·097), 40\% in those with the minor allele of rs111521887 (p=3·0?×?10(-4)), and 50\% in those with the minor allele of rs5743894 (p=2·93?×?10(-5)) compared with homozygous carriers of common alleles for these SNPs.Novel variants in TOLLIP and SPPL2C are associated with IPF susceptibility. One novel variant of TOLLIP, rs5743890, is also associated with mortality. These associations and the reduced expression of TOLLIP in patients with IPF who carry TOLLIP SNPs emphasise the importance of this gene in the disease.National Institutes of Health; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation; Coalition for Pulmonary Fibrosis; and Instituto de Salud Carlos III.},

These analyses are increasingly applied for clinical work and medicolegal problems. Differences in sampling, preparation and counting techniques, definitions of reference populations and expression of results have caused major difficulties in comparing results from different laboratories. Therefore it appeared necessary to set a goal to harmonize these analyses between the European laboratories active in this field. This article summarizes the work of a European Respiratory Society working group with participation from nine European laboratories. The five main issues touched upon are: 1) definitions of control populations and reference levels; 2) sampling, preparation and analytical techniques; 3) asbestos fibres in lung tissues in different pathologies; 4) asbestos bodies in lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum; and 5) basis for the interpretation of fibres and asbestos bodies in biological samples. These guidelines indicate the crucial importance of several factors for the interpretation of the results; namely, adequate sampling, comparable analytical procedures and expression of the results, the use of well-defined reference populations, and a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting the fibre retention and the dose-responses associated with the different asbestos-related diseases.},

It is recognized that the imposed symmetry between duration and intensity of exposure is a potential problem with this measure, but it is less widely recognized that the finding of an exposure-response relationship, using cumulative exposure as the exposure metric, does not necessarily imply that exposures were accurately or even consistently estimated. This report describes a simulation study drawn from a nested case-control analysis of mesothelioma in a cohort of asbestos cement workers. Intensity of exposure in the range of 0.1-40 fibers/ml was randomly assigned to subjects. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that there was no association between mesothelioma risk and the randomly assigned intensity of exposure. However, in 171 (86%) of 200 trials, mesothelioma risk was significantly associated with cumulative exposure, even though intensity of exposure remained randomly assigned. A strong exposure-response relationship might thus be misleading. One would be more confident about quantitative risk assessment when there are a large number of independent studies available for analysis.},

Prompted exposures and work activities showed little evidence of differential recall by parents of cases and controls (all OR < 1.2), but case parents were more likely to volunteer information about other exposures or activities (ORs: 1.35-1.71). Case mothers were also more likely than control mothers to report activities involving indirect exposure (OR = 1.41).

  abstract        = {A hospital-based case-control study of the association between past occupational exposure to asbestos and pleural mesothelioma was carried out in five regions of France. Between 1987 and 1993, 405 cases and 387 controls were interviewed. The job histories of these subjects were evaluated by a group of experts for exposure to asbestos fibers according to probability, intensity, and frequency. A cumulative exposure index was calculated as the product of these three parameters and the duration of the exposed job, summed over the entire working life. Among men, the odds ratio increased with the probability of exposure and was 1.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-1.9) for possible exposure and 3.6 (95% CI 2.4-5.3) for definite exposure. A dose-response relation was observed with the cumulative exposure index: The odds ratio increased from 1.2 (95% CI 0.8-1.8) for the lowest exposure category to 8.7 (95% CI 4.1-18.5) for the highest. Among women, the odds ratio for possible or definite exposure was 18.8 (95% CI 4.1-86.2). We found a clear dose-response relation between cumulative asbestos exposure and pleural mesothelioma in a population-based case-control study with retrospective assessment of exposure. A significant excess of mesothelioma was observed for levels of cumulative exposure that were probably far below the limits adopted in most industrial countries during the 1980s.},

The study comprised 262 cases with asbestosis and 265 controls with no asbestos-related disease previously studied for MnSOD, ECSOD, CAT, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and iNOS polymorphisms. Data on cumulative asbestos and smoking were available for all subjects. To assess gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions, logistic regression was used. The associations between MnSOD Ala -9Val polymorphism and the risk of asbestosis and between iNOS genotypes and asbestosis were modified by CAT -262 C > T polymorphism (P = 0.038; P = 0.031). A strong interaction was found between GSTM1-null polymorphism and smoking (P = 0.007), iNOS (CCTTT) n polymorphism and smoking (P = 0.054), and between iNOS (CCTTT) n polymorphism and cumulative asbestos exposure (P = 0.037). The findings of this study suggest that the interactions between different genotypes, genotypes and smoking, and between genotypes and asbestos exposure have an important influence on the development of asbestosis and should be seriously considered in future research on occupational/environmental asbestos-related diseases. },

This review also examines the issues of exposure measurement in both animal and human studies, and discusses the impact of these issues on determination of cause for asbestos-related diseases.

  abstract        = {The aim of this prospective study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of acid gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Sixty-five consecutive patients with well-defined IPF were subjected to 24-h pH monitoring and oesophageal manometry. A total of 133 consecutive patients with intractable asthma and symptoms of GER were used as comparisons. The prevalence of abnormal acid GER in IPF patients was 87%, with 76% and 63% demonstrating abnormal distal and proximal oesophageal acid exposures, respectively. Abnormal acid GER was significantly more common in IPF patients than asthma patients. Only 47% of IPF patients experienced classic GER symptoms. Despite treatment with standard doses of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), 12 out of 19 patients receiving PPIs during the 24-h pH monitoring had abnormal oesophageal acid exposures by pH probe. There was no correlation between IPF severity and acid GER severity. In conclusion, abnormal acid gastro-oesophageal reflux is highly prevalent, but often clinically occult in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Standard doses of proton pump inhibitors may not suppress the acid gastro-oesophageal reflux in this population. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine if acid abnormal gastro-oesophageal reflux represents an important risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis development or progression, and if optimal suppression of acid gastro-oesophageal reflux slows the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and/or decreases episodic exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

Data were used from a recent update of a cohort mortality study of workers in a South Carolina textile factory. Alternative exposure-response models were evaluated with Poisson regression. A model designed to evaluate evidence of a threshold response was also fitted. Lifetime risks of lung cancer and asbestosis were estimated with an actuarial approach that accounts for competing causes of death. A highly significant exposure-response relation was found for both lung cancer and asbestosis. The exposure-response relation for lung cancer seemed to be linear on a multiplicative scale, which is consistent with previous analyses of lung cancer and exposure to asbestos. In contrast, the exposure-response relation for asbestosis seemed to be nonlinear on a multiplicative scale in this analysis. There was no significant evidence for a threshold in models of either the lung cancer or asbestosis. The excess lifetime risk for white men exposed for 45 years at the recently revised OSHA standard of 0.1 fibre/ml was predicted to be about 5/1000 for lung cancer, and 2/1000 for asbestosis. This study confirms the findings from previous investigations of a strong exposure-response relation between exposure to chrysotile asbestos and mortality from lung cancer, and asbestosis. The risk estimates for lung cancer derived from this analysis are higher than those derived from other populations exposed to chrysotile asbestos. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.},

A cohort of 3072 workers exposed to chrysotile in a South Carolina asbestos textile plant (1916-77) was followed up for mortality through 2001. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed using US and South Carolina mortality rates. A job exposure matrix provided calendar time dependent estimates of chrysotile exposure concentrations. Poisson regression models were fitted for lung cancer and asbestosis. Covariates considered included sex, race, age, calendar time, birth cohort and time since first exposure. Cumulative exposure lags of 5 and 10 years were considered by disregarding exposure in the most recent 5 and 10 years, respectively. A majority of the cohort was deceased (64%) and 702 of the 1961 deaths occurred since the previous update. Mortality was elevated based on US referent rates for a priori causes of interest including all causes combined (SMR 1.33, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.39); all cancers (SMR 1.27, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.39); oesophageal cancer (SMR 1.87, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.99); lung cancer (SMR 1.95, 95% CI 1.68 to 2.24); ischaemic heart disease (SMR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.32); and pneumoconiosis and other respiratory diseases (SMR 4.81, 95% CI 3.84 to 5.94). Mortality remained elevated for these causes when South Carolina referent rates were used. Three cases of mesothelioma were observed among cohort members. Exposure-response modelling for lung cancer, using a linear relative risk model, produced a slope coefficient of 0.0198 (fibre-years/ml) (standard error 0.00496), when cumulative exposure was lagged 10 years. Poisson regression modelling confirmed significant positive relations between estimated chrysotile exposure and lung cancer and asbestosis mortality observed in previous updates of this cohort. This study confirms the findings from previous investigations of excess mortality from lung cancer and asbestosis and a strong exposure-response relation between estimated exposure to chrysotile and mortality from lung cancer and asbestosis.},

  abstract        = {Ascertainment of asbestosis and mesothelioma from underlying cause of death underestimates the burden of these diseases. The aims of this study were to estimate the true frequency of asbestosis and mesothelioma among asbestos workers in Great Britain (GB), and to identify factors associated with the risk of death with these diseases. The GB Asbestos Survey was established in 1971 to monitor long-term health outcomes among workers covered by regulations to control asbestos at work. Asbestosis and mesothelioma cases were defined by multiple cause of death, and were ascertained by identifying asbestos workers on the GB Asbestosis and Mesothelioma Registers. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated; the risks of asbestosis and mesothelioma were modeled with Poisson regression analysis. Deaths to the end of 2005 were included. There were 15,557 deaths between 1971 and 2005 among the 98,912 workers. Altogether 477 asbestosis and 649 mesothelioma cases were identified. The SMR for all causes was 1.42, for asbestosis 51.3, and for mesothelioma 13.5. In multiply adjusted analysis, age, sex, job, and birth cohort were significantly associated with asbestosis and mesothelioma. For asbestosis year of first exposure, and for mesothelioma latency, were also statistically significant. The asbestos workers experienced high mortality from all causes, asbestosis, and mesothelioma. There was some evidence that the risk of asbestosis and mesothelioma was lower in later birth cohorts and among those first occupationally exposed to asbestos more recently. Due to the long latency of both diseases, further follow-up is required to confirm these trends.},

  abstract        = {Evidence from the United Kingdom suggests that the number of deaths from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is increasing, although comparable international data are limited. We aimed to collate death certification data from multiple countries to determine global trends in mortality from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Data were obtained from the national statistics agencies of countries with relevant mortality records. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated, and Poisson regression modeling was used to calculate rate ratios. Meta-analysis was used to calculate an overall estimate of mortality change over time. Ten countries provided mortality data on pulmonary fibrosis over a period from 1999 to 2012. Age-standardized mortality ranged between 4 and 10 per 100,000 population for the most recent years of data, being lowest in Sweden (4.68 per 100,000), Spain (5.38 per 100,000), and New Zealand (5.55 per 100,000), and highest in the United Kingdom (9.84 per 100,000 in England and Wales, 10.71 per 100,000 in Scotland) and Japan (10.26 per 100,000). Positive associations with male sex and increasing age were consistently observed across all countries. There was an overall 2-3% annual increase in mortality depending on codes used for classification: For broad codes the overall rate ratio was 1.03 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.04; P < 0.001) and for narrow codes the overall rate ratio was 1.02 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.03; P < 0.001). Validation in a local cohort showed that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was recorded as the underlying cause of death in two-thirds of known cases and anywhere on the death certificate in 80% of cases. Mortality from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is increasing steadily worldwide, despite the fact that death certification will almost certainly underestimate true mortality. We estimate that there will be between 28,000 and 65,000 deaths in Europe and between 13,000 and 17,000 deaths in the United States from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis clinical syndrome in 2014. Variation between countries remains but is less than previously reported.},

A prospective cohort consisting of 586 workers in an asbestos textile factory was followed from 1 January 1972 to 31 December 2006. A structured questionnaire was administered to collect personal information and exposure data. Paired concentration samples measured in the workshops were used to convert dust concentrations to fibre concentrations. Individual cumulative asbestos exposure was estimated as the product of fibre concentrations and duration of employment in each job and expressed as fibre-years/ml. The vital status of cohort members was followed annually. Poisson regression analysis was applied to fit log-linear, log-quadratic, power, additive relative risk and categorical models to estimate exposure-response relationships between cumulative fibre exposure and mortality from lung cancer and asbestosis. Of the 226 deaths (14.6 per 1000 person-years) over the 35-year follow-up, 51 were from lung cancer (3.29 per 1000 person-years) and 37 from asbestosis (2.39 per 1000 person-years). A significant exposure-response relationships with either lung cancer or asbestosis (p<0.001) was observed in the final model. The power model with lagged 10 years was found to be the best model of those evaluated for both lung cancer (β coefficient=0.53) and asbestosis (β coefficient=0.63). The study confirmed strong associations between exposure to chrysotile asbestos and lung cancer and asbestosis, in which clear exposure-response relationships were observed.},

We discovered germline mutations in the gene encoding BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) in two families with a high incidence of mesothelioma, and we observed somatic alterations affecting BAP1 in familial mesotheliomas, indicating biallelic inactivation. In addition to mesothelioma, some BAP1 mutation carriers developed uveal melanoma. We also found germline BAP1 mutations in 2 of 26 sporadic mesotheliomas; both individuals with mutant BAP1 were previously diagnosed with uveal melanoma. We also observed somatic truncating BAP1 mutations and aberrant BAP1 expression in sporadic mesotheliomas without germline mutations. These results identify a BAP1-related cancer syndrome that is characterized by mesothelioma and uveal melanoma. We hypothesize that other cancers may also be involved and that mesothelioma predominates upon asbestos exposure. These findings will help to identify individuals at high risk of mesothelioma who could be targeted for early intervention.},

  abstract     = {The epidemic of mesothelioma in Cappadocia, Turkey, is unprecedented in medical history. In three Cappadocian villages, Karain, Tuzkoy and "old" Sarihidir, about 50% of all deaths (including neonatal deaths and traffic fatalities) have been caused by mesothelioma. No other epidemic in medical history has caused such a high incidence of death. This is even more unusual when considering that (I) epidemics are caused by infectious agents, not cancer, and (II) mesothelioma is a rare cancer. World-wide mesothelioma incidence varies between 1/10  in areas with no asbestos industry to about 10-30/10  in areas with asbestos industry. This article reviews how the mesothelioma epidemic was discovered in Cappadocia by Dr. Baris (my mentor), how we initially linked the epidemic to erionite exposure, and later (with Dr. Carbone) to the interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental exposure. Our team's work had an important positive impact on the lives of those living in Cappadocia and also in many genetically predisposed families living around the world. I will discuss how the work that started in three remote Cappadocian villages led to the award of a NCI P01 grant to support our studies. Our studies proved that genetics modulates mineral fiber carcinogenesis and led to the discovery that carriers of germline   mutations have a very high risk of developing mesothelioma and other malignancies. A new, very active field of research developed following our discoveries to elucidate the mechanism by which   modulates mineral fiber carcinogenesis as well as to identify additional genes that when mutated increase the risk of mesothelioma and other environmentally related cancers. I am the only surviving member of this research team who saw all the phases of this research and I believe it is important to provide an accurate report, which hopefully will inspire others.},

The mechanisms through which these two toxic agents interact to promote lung tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Here, we begin to dissect the inflammatory signals induced by asbestos in combination with CS using a rodent inhalation model and in vitro cell culture. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were exposed to room air as a control, CS, and/or asbestos (4 days per week to CS and 1 day per week to asbestos for 5 weeks). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was collected following exposure and analyzed for inflammatory mediators. Asbestos-exposed mice displayed an increased innate immune response consistent with NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Compared to mice exposed only to asbestos, animals coexposed to CS + asbestos displayed attenuated levels of innate immune mediators and altered inflammatory cell recruitment. Histopathological changes in CS + asbestos-exposed mice correlated with attenuated fibroproliferative lesion development relative to their counterparts exposed only to asbestos. In vitro experiments using a human monocyte cell line (THP-1 cells) supported the in vivo results in that coexposure to cigarette smoke extract repressed NLRP3 inflammasome markers in cells treated with asbestos. These observations indicate that CS represses central components of the innate immune response to inhaled asbestos.},

  abstract        = {The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are developing joint estimates of the work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO Joint Estimates). For this, systematic reviews of studies estimating the prevalence of exposure to selected occupational risk factors will be conducted to provide input data for estimations of the number of exposed workers. A critical part of systematic review methods is to assess risk of bias (RoB) of individual studies. In this article, we present and describe the development of such a tool, called the Risk of Bias in Studies estimating Prevalence of Exposure to Occupational risk factors (RoB-SPEO) tool; report results from RoB-SPEO's pilot testing; note RoB-SPEO's limitations; and suggest how the tool might be tested and developed further. Selected existing RoB tools used in environmental and occupational health systematic reviews were reviewed and analysed. From existing tools, we identified domains for the new tool and, if necessary, added new domains. For each domain, we then identified and integrated components from the existing tools (i.e. instructions, domains, guiding questions, considerations, ratings and rating criteria), and, if necessary, we developed new components. Finally, we elicited feedback from other systematic review methodologists and exposure scientists and agreed upon RoB-SPEO. Nine experts pilot tested RoB-SPEO, and we calculated a raw measure of inter-rater agreement (P ) for each of its domain, rating P  < 0.4 as poor, 0.4 ≤ P  ≥ 0.8 as substantial and P  > 0.80 as almost perfect agreement. Our review found no standard tool for assessing RoB in prevalence studies of exposure to occupational risk factors. We identified six existing tools for environmental and occupational health systematic reviews and found that their components for assessing RoB differ considerably. With the new RoB-SPEO tool, assessors judge RoB for each of eight domains: (1) bias in selection of participants into the study; (2) bias due to a lack of blinding of study personnel; (3) bias due to exposure misclassification; (4) bias due to incomplete exposure data; (5) bias due to conflict of interest; (6) bias due to selective reporting of exposures; (7) bias due to difference in numerator and denominator; and (8) other bias. The RoB-SPEO's ratings are low, probably low, probably high, high or no information. Pilot testing of the RoB-SPEO tool found substantial inter-rater agreement for six domains (range of P  for these domains: 0.51-0.80), but poor agreement for two domains (i.e. P  of 0.31 and 0.33 for biases due to incomplete exposure data and in selection of participants into the study, respectively). Limitations of RoB-SPEO include that it has not yet been fully performance-tested. We developed the RoB-SPEO tool for assessing RoB in prevalence studies of exposure to occupational risk factors. The tool will be applied and its performance tested in the ongoing systematic reviews for the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.},

  abstract        = {Over the past decade, several large registries of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have been established. These registries are collecting a wealth of longitudinal data on thousands of patients with this rare disease. The data collected in these registries will be complementary to data collected in clinical trials because the patient populations studied in registries have a broader spectrum of disease severity and comorbidities and can be followed for a longer period of time. Maintaining the quality and completeness of registry databases presents administrative and resourcing challenges, but it is important to ensuring the robustness of the analyses. Data from patient registries have already helped improve understanding of the clinical characteristics of patients with IPF, the impact that the disease has on their quality of life and survival, and current practices in diagnosis and management. In the future, analyses of biospecimens linked to detailed patient profiles will provide the opportunity to identify biomarkers linked to disease progression, facilitating the development of precision medicine approaches for prognosis and therapy in patients with IPF.},

  abstract        = {Exposure to environmental toxicants (ET) results in specific organ damage and auto-immune diseases, mostly mediated by inflammatory responses. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been found to be the major initiator of the associated pathologic inflammation. It has been found that ETs can trigger all the signals required for an NLRP3-mediated response. The exaggerated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its end product IL-1β, is responsible for the pathogenesis caused by many ETs including pesticides, organic pollutants, heavy metals, and crystalline compounds. Therefore, an extensive study of these chemicals and their mechanisms of inflammasome (INF) activation may provide the scientific evidence for possible targeting of this pathway by proposing possible protective agents that have been previously shown to affect INF compartments and its activation. Melatonin and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are among the safest and the most studied of these agents, which affect a wide variety of cellular and physiological processes. These molecules have been shown to suppress the NLRP3 inflammasome mostly through the regulation of cellular redox status and the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, rendering them potential promising compounds to overcome ET-mediated organ damage. In the present review, we have made an effort to extensively review the ETs that exert their pathogenesis via the stimulation of inflammation, their precise mechanisms of action and the possible protective agents that could be potentially used to protect against such toxicants.},

Although alveolar macrophages are believed to initiate these inflammatory responses, the mechanism by which this occurs has been unclear. Here we show that the inflammatory response and subsequent development of pulmonary fibrosis after inhalation of silica is dependent on the Nalp3 inflammasome. Stimulation of macrophages with silica results in the activation of caspase-1 in a Nalp3-dependent manner. Macrophages deficient in components of the Nalp3 inflammasome were incapable of secreting the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 in response to silica. Similarly, asbestos was capable of activating caspase-1 in a Nalp3-dependent manner. Activation of the Nalp3 inflammasome by silica required both an efflux of intracellular potassium and the generation of reactive oxygen species. This study demonstrates a key role for the Nalp3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of pneumoconiosis.},

How the presence of pathogenic dust is recognized and how chronic inflammatory diseases are triggered are poorly understood. Here, we show that asbestos and silica are sensed by the Nalp3 inflammasome, whose subsequent activation leads to interleukin-1beta secretion. Inflammasome activation is triggered by reactive oxygen species, which are generated by a NADPH oxidase upon particle phagocytosis. (NADPH is the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.) In a model of asbestos inhalation, Nalp3-/- mice showed diminished recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lungs, paralleled by lower cytokine production. Our findings implicate the Nalp3 inflammasome in particulate matter-related pulmonary diseases and support its role as a major proinflammatory "danger" receptor.},

The mechanisms by which silica and other crystals activate immune cells are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that silica and aluminum salt crystals activated inflammasomes formed by the cytoplasmic receptor NALP3. NALP3 activation required phagocytosis of crystals, and this uptake subsequently led to lysosomal damage and rupture. 'Sterile' lysosomal damage (without crystals) also induced NALP3 activation, and inhibition of either phagosomal acidification or cathepsin B activity impaired NALP3 activation. Our results indicate that the NALP3 inflammasome senses lysosomal damage as an endogenous 'danger' signal.},

Priming and activation of these intracellular protein platforms trigger the maturation of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, most notably, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, to promulgate innate immune defenses. Although classically studied in models of gout, Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis, the importance and mechanisms of action of inflammasome priming and activation have recently been elucidated in cells of the respiratory tract where they modulate the responses to a number of inhaled pathogenic particles and fibres. Most notably, inflammasome activation appears to regulate the balance between tissue repair and inflammation after inhalation of pathogenic pollutants such as asbestos, crystalline silica (CS), and airborne particulate matter (PM). Different types of fibres and particles may have distinct mechanisms of inflammasome interaction and outcome. This review summarizes the structure and function of inflammasomes, the interplay between various chemokines and cytokines and cell types of the lung and pleura after inflammasome activation, and the events leading to the development of non-malignant (allergic airway disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asbestosis, silicosis) and malignant (mesothelioma, lung cancer) diseases by pathogenic particulates. In addition, it emphasizes the importance of communication between cells of the immune system, target cells of these diseases, and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in regulation of inflammasome-mediated events.},

  abstract        = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and irreversible fibrosing lung disease of unknown etiology and with an unfavorable outcome, leading ultimately to death due to respiratory failure. To date, no treatment strategies have been effective in modifying the natural course of IPF and its fatal outcome. The aberrant parenchymal remodeling is characterized by the expansion of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, which form characteristic subepithelial foci, and by the abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix in the lung parenchyma. Although the pathophysiology underlying this disease has not yet been fully elucidated, animal models of pulmonary fibrosis have provided contributions in dissecting the molecular basis of this disease, focusing on the role of cytokines and chemokines as important pathogenetic mediators of lung fibrosis. Starting with the data obtained from animal models, this article provides a comment on a number of findings that suggest the possible role of the chemokine/cytokine system in the pathogenesis of IPF.},

  abstract        = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by early and persistent mucus accumulation and neutrophilic inflammation in the distal airways. Identification of the factors in CF mucopurulent secretions that perpetuate CF mucoinflammation may provide strategies for novel CF pharmacotherapies. We show that IL-1β, with IL-1α, dominated the mucin prosecretory activities of supernatants of airway mucopurulent secretions (SAMS). Like SAMS, IL-1β alone induced MUC5B and MUC5AC protein secretion and mucus hyperconcentration in CF human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. Mechanistically, IL-1β induced the sterile α motif-pointed domain containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) and downstream endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling 2 (ERN2) to upregulate mucin gene expression. Increased mRNA levels of IL1B, SPDEF, and ERN2 were associated with increased MUC5B and MUC5AC expression in the distal airways of excised CF lungs. Administration of an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) blocked SAMS-induced expression of mucins and proinflammatory mediators in CF HBE cells. In conclusion, IL-1α and IL-1β are upstream components of a signaling pathway, including IL-1R1 and downstream SPDEF and ERN2, that generate a positive feedback cycle capable of producing persistent mucus hyperconcentration and IL-1α and/or IL-1β-mediated neutrophilic inflammation in the absence of infection in CF airways. Targeting this pathway therapeutically may ameliorate mucus obstruction and inflammation-induced structural damage in young CF children.},

Here we show in humans that MUC5B, a mucin thought to be restricted to conducting airways, is co-expressed with surfactant protein C (SFTPC) in type 2 alveolar epithelia and in epithelial cells lining honeycomb cysts, indicating that cell types involved in lung fibrosis in distal airspace express MUC5B. In mice, we demonstrate that Muc5b concentration in bronchoalveolar epithelia is related to impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) and to the extent and persistence of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. We also establish the ability of the mucolytic agent P-2119 to restore MCC and to suppress bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in the setting of Muc5b overexpression. Our findings suggest that mucociliary dysfunction might play a causative role in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice overexpressing Muc5b, and that MUC5B in distal airspaces is a potential therapeutic target in humans with IPF.},

  abstract        = {Inflammasomes are multimeric protein complexes that typically comprise a sensor, an adaptor and the zymogen procaspase-1. An inflammasome assembles in response to a diverse range of pathogen-associated or danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs). The inflammasome platform leads to activation of caspase-1 through proximity-induced self-cleavage, which further induces maturation of interleukins 1β and 18 (IL-1β and IL-18) through proteolytic cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Activated caspase-1 also cleaves gasdermin D, which leads to a particular form of cell death called pyroptosis. Mutations in genes that encode inflammasome components are associated with many inflammatory disorders, and studies in the past decade have highlighted the importance of appropriate activation of the inflammasome in homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. Therefore, much attention is being paid to uncover the modulators and regulators of inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis. This Cell Science at a Glance article and accompanying poster outlines the concepts in the activation of inflammasome sensors and assembly of the inflammasome platform. We also discuss recent insights into the mechanisms of regulation of inflammasome activity and the induction of cell death by pyroptosis.},

  abstract     = {Inflammation is triggered by a repertoire of receptors detecting infections and damages. Some of these receptors directly bind microbial ligands, while others recognize endogenous molecules exposed under stress conditions, including infections. Most of these receptors can be engaged by a relatively limited number of stimuli. Differently, NLRP3 acts as a broad sensor of cell homeostasis rupture and can be activated downstream of a plethora of stimuli. NLRP3 then assembles a multiprotein platform resulting in caspase-1 activation, which controls, by direct cleavage, the maturation of cytosolic pro-cytokines including pro-interleukin-1β. In addition, caspase-1 processes cytosolic gasdermin-D and unleashes its pore-forming N-terminal domain, leading to the release of mature cytosolic cytokines and alarmins, as well as pyroptotic cell lysis. Accumulating evidences of the aggravating role of NLRP3-mediated inflammation in various highly prevalent human conditions, including diabetes, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, raises a huge clinical interest. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism governing NLRP3 activation remains insufficiently understood. In line with the detrimental consequences of NLRP3 activation illustrated by the aforementioned pathologies, this process is tightly regulated. In this review, we address the current understanding of the control of NLRP3 activity which can be divided into two coordinated processes referred to as priming and activation. In particular, we detail the emerging role of NLRP3 post-translational modifications critical in inflammasome assembly regulation.},

  abstract        = {Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP), resulting from the inhalation of silica-containing coal mine dust, is characterized by fibrosing nodular lesions that eventually develop into progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, it has been hypothesized that inflammasomes could have a crucial role in the host response to silica and recent studies show that the inflammasome contributes to inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. NLRP3, CARD8 are components of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which triggers caspase 1-mediated IL-1β and IL-18 release. In the present study, we investigated whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in inflammasome genes are associated with CWP. We performed an association study analyzing 3 NLRP3, 1 CARD8, 1 IL-1β, 2 IL-18 SNPs in a case-control study of 697 CWP and 694 controls. Genotyping was carried out by the TaqMan method. The NLRP3 rs1539019 TT genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of CWP (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-1.81), compared with the GG/GT genotype, in particular among smokers (adjusted OR = 1.67, 95%CI = 1.15-2.42). In addition, the polymorphism was significantly associated with risk of CWP patients with stage I. This is the first report showing an association between the NLRP3 rs1539019 polymorphism and CWP, and suggests that this polymorphism may confer increased risk for the development of the disease. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings.},

  abstract        = {Innate immunity is a first line defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection where inflammasome activation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta, plays a major role. Thus, genetic polymorphisms in innate immunity-related genes such as CARD8 and NLRP3 may contribute to the understanding of why most exposed individuals do not develop infection. Our aim was to investigate the association between polymorphisms in CARD8 and NLRP3 and active tuberculosis (TB) as well as their relationship to treatment outcome in a high-endemic setting for TB. Polymorphisms in CARD8 (C10X) and NLRP3 (Q705K) were analysed in 1190 TB patients and 1990 healthy donors (HD). There was a significant association between homozygotes in the CARD8 polymorphism and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), which was not the case for pulmonary TB or HDs. Among TB-patients, there was an association between poor treatment outcome and the NLRP3 (Q705K) polymorphism. Our study shows that inflammasome polymorphisms are associated with EPTB and poor clinical outcome in active TB in Ethiopia. The practical implications and determining causal relationships on a mechanistic level needs further study.},

  abstract        = {Triangulation is the practice of obtaining more reliable answers to research questions through integrating results from several different approaches, where each approach has different key sources of potential bias that are unrelated to each other. With respect to causal questions in aetiological epidemiology, if the results of different approaches all point to the same conclusion, this strengthens confidence in the finding. This is particularly the case when the key sources of bias of some of the approaches would predict that findings would point in opposite directions if they were due to such biases. Where there are inconsistencies, understanding the key sources of bias of each approach can help to identify what further research is required to address the causal question. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how triangulation might be used to improve causal inference in aetiological epidemiology. We propose a minimum set of criteria for use in triangulation in aetiological epidemiology, summarize the key sources of bias of several approaches and describe how these might be integrated within a triangulation framework. We emphasize the importance of being explicit about the expected direction of bias within each approach, whenever this is possible, and seeking to identify approaches that would be expected to bias the true causal effect in different directions. We also note the importance, when comparing results, of taking account of differences in the duration and timing of exposures. We provide three examples to illustrate these points.},

The evidence syntheses were discussed and recommendations formulated by a multidisciplinary committee of IPF experts. The evidence was appraised and recommendations were formulated, written, and graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The guideline panel updated the diagnostic criteria for IPF. Previously defined patterns of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) were refined to patterns of UIP, probable UIP, indeterminate, and alternate diagnosis. For patients with newly detected interstitial lung disease (ILD) who have a high-resolution computed tomography scan pattern of probable UIP, indeterminate, or an alternative diagnosis, conditional recommendations were made for performing BAL and surgical lung biopsy; because of lack of evidence, no recommendation was made for or against performing transbronchial lung biopsy or lung cryobiopsy. In contrast, for patients with newly detected ILD who have a high-resolution computed tomography scan pattern of UIP, strong recommendations were made against performing surgical lung biopsy, transbronchial lung biopsy, and lung cryobiopsy, and a conditional recommendation was made against performing BAL. Additional recommendations included a conditional recommendation for multidisciplinary discussion and a strong recommendation against measurement of serum biomarkers for the sole purpose of distinguishing IPF from other ILDs. The guideline panel provided recommendations related to the diagnosis of IPF.},

We investigated the prevalence of CIP in silicosis and mixed-dust pneumoconiosis and sought morphologic differences of CIP between the pneumoconiosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We reviewed CT scans of 243 silicosis and mixed-dust pneumoconiosis patients to identify any cases of parenchymal lung lesions showing a CIP pattern, and compared the CT findings with those of 62 patients with IPF. Two observers independently scored CT images and classified the CT pattern as typical or not typical for IPF. Differences were sought between the groups using a nonparametric test, Fisher exact test, and a logistic regression analysis. A radiopathologic correlation was performed in 11 pneumoconiosis patients. Twenty-eight patients (11.5%) showed CIP on CT. Seven patients (25%) showed a pattern not typical of IPF, while the remaining patients showed a pattern typical of IPF, 11 of which were confirmed pathologically. The extent of fibrosis did not differ between the groups; however, patients with pneumoconiosis showed less traction bronchiectasis (odds ratio [OR], 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08 to 0.48; p < 0.001), more subpleural homogeneous attenuation (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.55 to 4.23; p < 0.001), and fibrosis was more randomly distributed (OR, 315.38; 95% CI, 4.68 to 21244.63; p = 0.007). Pathologically, subpleural homogeneous attenuation corresponded to dense fibrosis often with abundant silicotic nodules. Prevalence of CIP in pneumoconiosis was approximately 12% on CT. One fourth of patients showed an atypical IPF pattern, and the others showed a typical IPF pattern.},

  abstract        = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common and lethal of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, is defined by a radiological and/or pathological pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). However, UIP is not synonymous with IPF as other clinical conditions may be associated with UIP, including chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, collagen vascular disease, drug toxicity, asbestosis, familial IPF and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. Differentiating IPF ("idiopathic UIP") from conditions that mimic IPF ("secondary UIP") has substantial therapeutic and prognostic implications. A number of radiological and histological clues may help distinguish IPF from other conditions with a UIP pattern of fibrosis, but their appreciation requires extensive expertise in interstitial lung disease as well as an integrated multidisciplinary approach involving pulmonologists, radiologists and pathologists. In addition, multidisciplinary discussions may decrease the time to initial IPF diagnosis and, thus, enable more timely management. This concept was strongly emphasised by the 2011 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines. This article highlights, with the aid of a clinical case, the difficulties in making a diagnosis of IPF in clinical practice. Yet, an accurate diagnosis is critical, particularly given the availability of drugs that may reduce the pace of functional decline and disease progression in IPF.},

  abstract        = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a complex lung disease characterised by scarring of the lung that is believed to result from an atypical response to injury of the epithelium. Genome-wide association studies have reported signals of association implicating multiple pathways including host defence, telomere maintenance, signalling and cell-cell adhesion. To improve our understanding of factors that increase IPF susceptibility by identifying previously unreported genetic associations. We conducted genome-wide analyses across three independent studies and meta-analysed these results to generate the largest genome-wide association study of IPF to date (2,668 IPF cases and 8,591 controls). We performed replication in two independent studies (1,456 IPF cases and 11,874 controls) and functional analyses (including statistical fine-mapping, investigations into gene expression and testing for enrichment of IPF susceptibility signals in regulatory regions) to determine putatively causal genes. Polygenic risk scores were used to assess the collective effect of variants not reported as associated with IPF. We identified and replicated three new genome-wide significant (P<5×10-8) signals of association with IPF susceptibility (associated with altered gene expression of KIF15, MAD1L1 and DEPTOR) and confirmed associations at 11 previously reported loci. Polygenic risk score analyses showed that the combined effect of many thousands of as-yet unreported IPF susceptibility variants contribute to IPF susceptibility. The observation that decreased DEPTOR expression associates with increased susceptibility to IPF, supports recent studies demonstrating the importance of mTOR signalling in lung fibrosis. New signals of association implicating KIF15 and MAD1L1 suggest a possible role of mitotic spindle-assembly genes in IPF susceptibility.

  abstract        = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease characterised by fibrosis of the lung parenchyma and loss of lung function. Although the pathogenic pathways involved in IPF have not been fully elucidated, IPF is believed to be caused by repetitive alveolar epithelial cell injury and dysregulated repair, in which there is uncontrolled proliferation of lung fibroblasts and differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which excessively deposit extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the interstitial space. A number of profibrotic mediators including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and transforming growth factor-β are believed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of IPF. Nintedanib is a potent small molecule inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGF receptor, FGF receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. Data from in vitro studies have shown that nintedanib interferes with processes active in fibrosis such as fibroblast proliferation, migration and differentiation, and the secretion of ECM. In addition, nintedanib has shown consistent anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity in animal models of lung fibrosis. These data provide a strong rationale for the clinical efficacy of nintedanib in patients with IPF, which has recently been demonstrated in phase III clinical trials.},

  abstract        = {Interstitial lung fibrosis can develop as a consequence of occupational or medical exposure, as a result of genetic defects, and after trauma or acute lung injury leading to fibroproliferative acute respiratory distress syndrome, or it can develop in an idiopathic manner. The pathogenesis of each form of lung fibrosis remains poorly understood. They each result in a progressive loss of lung function with increasing dyspnea, and most forms ultimately result in mortality. To better understand the pathogenesis of lung fibrotic disorders, multiple animal models have been developed. This review summarizes the common and emerging models of lung fibrosis to highlight their usefulness in understanding the cell-cell and soluble mediator interactions that drive fibrotic responses. Recent advances have allowed for the development of models to study targeted injuries of Type II alveolar epithelial cells, fibroblastic autonomous effects, and targeted genetic defects. Repetitive dosing in some models has more closely mimicked the pathology of human fibrotic lung disease. We also have a much better understanding of the fact that the aged lung has increased susceptibility to fibrosis. Each of the models reviewed in this report offers a powerful tool for studying some aspect of fibrotic lung disease.},

This Swedish population based case-control study analysed 577 incident RA cases and 659 randomly selected controls, all men aged 18-70 years, included during May 1996 to May 2006. Self-reported silica exposure, defined as exposure to stone dust, rock drilling or stone crushing and cigarette smoking was registered. ACPA status among cases was analysed. Silica-exposed subjects were found to have a moderately increased risk of ACPA-positive RA (odds ratio (OR) adjusted for age and residency=1.67 (95% CI 1.13 to 2.48), but not of ACPA-negative RA (OR=0.98 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.66)), compared with subjects unexposed to silica. exposed to rock drilling were found to have a somewhat more markedly increased risk of ACPA-positive RA (OR=2.34 (95% CI 1.17 to 4.68)). A high risk of developing ACPA-positive RA was observed among silica-exposed current smokers (OR=7.36 (95% CI 3.31 to 16.38)), exceeding the risk expected from the separate effects of silica exposure and current smoking, indicating an interaction between these exposures (attributable proportion due to interaction=0.60 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.95)). Silica exposure combined with smoking among men is associated with an increased risk of developing ACPA-positive RA. These results suggest that different inhalation exposures may interact in the aetiology of ACPA-positive RA.},

The autoantigens in RA are neither tissue nor organ-specific, but comprise a broad collection of post-translational modified proteins, such as citrullinated proteins. These modifications are likely to be triggered by innate stimuli. In genetically susceptible hosts, they can lead to a more substantiated secondary autoimmune reaction targeting the joints and precipitating the clinical onset of RA. Both innate and adaptive mechanisms will then closely interplay to promote chronic joint inflammation in the several absence of appropriate treatment. This scenario, is shared with other autoimmune diseases where potentially pathogenic immune responses are present already before disease onset. Better understanding of these processes will allow both earlier diagnosis of RA and identification of those healthy individuals that are at risk of developing disease, opening possibilities for disease prevention. In this review, we discuss the iterative processes of innate and adaptive immunity responsible for the (longitudinal) development of immune reactions that may contribute to the development of RA.},

Relative gene expression of NLRP3-inflammasome components was characterised in PBMCs of 29 patients receiving infliximab. A total of 1278 Caucasian patients with RA from the Biologics in Rheumatoid Arthritis Genetics and Genomics Study Syndicate (BRAGGSS) cohort receiving tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists (infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept) were genotyped for 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), spanning the genes NLRP3, MEFV and CARD8. Regression analyses were performed to test for association between genotype and susceptibility and treatment response (disease activity score across 28 joints (DAS28) and EULAR improvement criteria) at 6 months, with secondary expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses. At baseline, gene expression of ASC, MEFV, NLRP3-FL, NLRP3-SL and CASP1 were significantly higher compared with controls whereas CARD8 was lower in the patients. Caspase-1 and interleukin-18 levels were significantly raised in patients with RA. SNPs in NLRP3 showed association with RA susceptibility and EULAR response to anti-TNF in the BRAGGSS cohort, and in monocytes but not B cells, in eQTL analysis of 283 healthy controls. CARD8 SNPs were associated with RA susceptibility and DAS28 improvement in response to anti-TNF and eQTL effects in monocytes and B cells. This study found evidence of modulation of the NLRP3-inflammasome in patients with RA prior to receiving infliximab and some evidence of association for SNPs at NLRP3 and CARD8 loci with RA susceptibility and response to anti-TNF. The SNPs associated with susceptibility/response are not the main eQTL variants for either locus, and the associations with treatment response require replication in an independent cohort.},

  abstract        = {Innate immunity genes polymorphisms are known to be involved in the multifactorial susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Recently it has been hypothesized that inflammasomes could play an important role in the host response to viruses. The aim of our study is to verify if single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding for NALPs-innate immune receptors that form molecular complexes leading to the production of IL-1beta and the activation of immune response-could influence the individual susceptibility to HIV-1. We performed an association study analyzing 2 NLRP1 and NLRP3 SNPs in HIV-1 vertically infected Brazilian children (n = 135), HIV-1-infected Brazilain adults (n = 192) and HIV-1-positive Italian seropositive subjects (n = 192). The 3'UTR NLRP3 rs10754558 SNP was associated with HIV-1 infection in all the studied groups. The frequency of rs10754558 G allele was differently distributed within seropositive subjects (HIV+) and controls, and in particular the GG genotype was less frequent in HIV+. susceptibility to HIV-1 infection is associated with a 3'UTR NLRP3 polymorphism. This is the first report linking SNPs in the NALPs with HIV-1 infection, and further epidemiologic and functional studies are needed to deeper investigate the role of inflammasome in the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection.},

Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms within NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, CARD8, CASP1, and IL1B genes were analyzed in 150 HIV-1-infected Brazilian subjects and 158 healthy controls. The 2 polymorphisms rs10754558 in NLRP3 and rs1143634 in IL1B were significantly associated to the HIV-1 infection. These findings supported the previously hypothesized involvement of NALP3-inflammasome in HIV-1 pathogenesis, underlining once more the key role of inflammation and innate immunity in the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection.},

  abstract        = {Preclinical data have suggested that nintedanib, an intracellular inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, inhibits processes involved in the progression of lung fibrosis. Although the efficacy of nintedanib has been shown in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, its efficacy across a broad range of fibrosing lung diseases is unknown. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial conducted in 15 countries, we randomly assigned patients with fibrosing lung disease affecting more than 10% of lung volume on high-resolution computed tomography (CT) to receive nintedanib at a dose of 150 mg twice daily or placebo. All the patients met criteria for progression of interstitial lung disease in the past 24 months despite treatment and had a forced vital capacity (FVC) of at least 45% of the predicted value and a diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide ranging from 30 to less than 80% of the predicted value. Randomization was stratified according to the fibrotic pattern (a pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia [UIP] or other fibrotic patterns) on high-resolution CT. The primary end point was the annual rate of decline in the FVC, as assessed over a 52-week period. The two primary populations for analysis were the overall population and patients with a UIP-like fibrotic pattern. A total of 663 patients were treated. In the overall population, the adjusted rate of decline in the FVC was -80.8 ml per year with nintedanib and -187.8 ml per year with placebo, for a between-group difference of 107.0 ml per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.4 to 148.5; P<0.001). In patients with a UIP-like fibrotic pattern, the adjusted rate of decline in the FVC was -82.9 ml per year with nintedanib and -211.1 ml per year with placebo, for a difference of 128.2 ml (95% CI, 70.8 to 185.6; P<0.001). Diarrhea was the most common adverse event, as reported in 66.9% and 23.9% of patients treated with nintedanib and placebo, respectively. Abnormalities on liver-function testing were more common in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group. In patients with progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases, the annual rate of decline in the FVC was significantly lower among patients who received nintedanib than among those who received placebo. Diarrhea was a common adverse event. (Funded by Boehringer Ingelheim; INBUILD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02999178.).},

  abstract        = {The NLRP3-inflammasome, implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory disorders, has been analysed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Relative gene expression of NLRP3-inflammasome components was characterised in PBMCs of 29 patients receiving infliximab. A total of 1278 Caucasian patients with RA from the Biologics in Rheumatoid Arthritis Genetics and Genomics Study Syndicate (BRAGGSS) cohort receiving tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists (infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept) were genotyped for 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), spanning the genes NLRP3, MEFV and CARD8. Regression analyses were performed to test for association between genotype and susceptibility and treatment response (disease activity score across 28 joints (DAS28) and EULAR improvement criteria) at 6 months, with secondary expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses. At baseline, gene expression of ASC, MEFV, NLRP3-FL, NLRP3-SL and CASP1 were significantly higher compared with controls whereas CARD8 was lower in the patients. Caspase-1 and interleukin-18 levels were significantly raised in patients with RA. SNPs in NLRP3 showed association with RA susceptibility and EULAR response to anti-TNF in the BRAGGSS cohort, and in monocytes but not B cells, in eQTL analysis of 283 healthy controls. CARD8 SNPs were associated with RA susceptibility and DAS28 improvement in response to anti-TNF and eQTL effects in monocytes and B cells. This study found evidence of modulation of the NLRP3-inflammasome in patients with RA prior to receiving infliximab and some evidence of association for SNPs at NLRP3 and CARD8 loci with RA susceptibility and response to anti-TNF. The SNPs associated with susceptibility/response are not the main eQTL variants for either locus, and the associations with treatment response require replication in an independent cohort.},

  abstract        = {Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is caused by gastric acid entering the esophagus. GERD has high prevalence and is the major risk factor for Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). We conduct a large GERD GWAS meta-analysis (80,265 cases, 305,011 controls), identifying 25 independent genome-wide significant loci for GERD. Several of the implicated genes are existing or putative drug targets. Loci discovery is greatest with a broad GERD definition (including cases defined by self-report or medication data). Further, 91% of the GERD risk-increasing alleles also increase BE and/or EA risk, greatly expanding gene discovery for these traits. Our results map genes for GERD and related traits and uncover potential new drug targets for these conditions.},

  abstract        = {The role of the lung microbiome in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is unknown. We investigated whether unique microbial signatures were associated with progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Patients (aged 35-80 years) with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis within 4 years of diagnosis from the Correlating Outcomes with biochemical Markers to Estimate Time-progression (COMET) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis study were followed up for a maximum of 80 weeks. Progression-free survival was defined as time to death, acute exacerbation, lung transplant, or decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) of 10% or greater or decrease in diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) of 15% or greater. DNA was isolated from 55 samples of bronchoscopic alveolar lavage. 454 pyrosequencing was used to assign operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to bacteria based on a 3% sequence divergence. Adjusted Cox models were used to identify OTUs that were significantly associated with progression-free survival at a p<0.10. These OTUs were then used in the analysis of the principal components. The association between principal components and microbes with high factor loadings and progression-free survival were assessed with Cox regression analyses. The COMET study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01071707. Mean FVC was 70.1% (SD 17.0) and DLCO 42.3% (14.0) of predicted. Disease progression was significantly associated with increased relative abundance of two OTUs-Streptococcus OTU 1345 (relative risk 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.18; p=0.0009) and Staphylococcus OTU 1348 (1.16, 1.03-1.31, p=0.012). Thresholds for relative abundance of each OTU associated with progression-free survival were more than 3.9% for Streptococcus OTU 1345 (10.19, 2.94-35.35; p=0.0002) and more than 1.8% for Staphylococcus OTU 1348 (5.06, 1.71-14.93; p=0.003). These preliminary data suggest progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is associated with the presence of specific members within the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus genera. Additional research will be needed to identify the specific bacterial species and to ascertain whether this is a causal association. National Institutes of Health.},

  abstract        = {Respiratory tract infections are common in patients suffering from pulmonary fibrosis. The interplay between bacterial infection and fibrosis is characterised poorly. To assess the effect of Gram-positive bacterial infection on fibrosis exacerbation in mice. Fibrosis progression in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae was examined in two different mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis. We demonstrate that wild-type mice exposed to adenoviral vector delivery of active transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFß1) or diphteria toxin (DT) treatment of transgenic mice expressing the DT receptor (DTR) under control of the surfactant protein C (SPC) promoter (SPC-DTR) to induce pulmonary fibrosis developed progressive fibrosis following infection with Spn, without exhibiting impaired lung protective immunity against Spn. Antibiotic treatment abolished infection-induced fibrosis progression. The cytotoxin pneumolysin (Ply) of Spn caused this phenomenon in a TLR4-independent manner, as Spn lacking Ply (SpnΔply) failed to trigger progressive fibrogenesis, whereas purified recombinant Ply did. Progressive fibrogenesis was also observed in AdTGFβ1-exposed Ply-challenged TLR4 KO mice. Increased apoptotic cell death of alveolar epithelial cells along with an attenuated intrapulmonary release of antifibrogenic prostaglandin E2 was found to underlie progressive fibrogenesis in Ply-challenged AdTGFβ1-exposed mice. Importantly, vaccination of mice with the non-cytotoxic Ply derivative B (PdB) substantially attenuated Ply-induced progression of lung fibrosis in AdTGFβ1-exposed mice. Our data unravel a novel mechanism by which infection with Spn through Ply release induces progression of established lung fibrosis, which can be attenuated by protein-based vaccination of mice.},

We further identified and characterized a nine-gene, iron-regulated operon, designated sbn and situated between sirABC and galE on the S. aureus chromosome, that is involved in the production of a siderophore. Mutation of the sbnE gene, in both RN6390 and Newman, eliminates the ability of these strains to produce a siderophore under iron-limited growth conditions, while introduction of multicopy sbnE into sbnE mutants complemented the inability of the mutants to produce the siderophore. sbnE mutants, in both the RN6390 and Newman backgrounds, displayed a drastic growth deficiency, compared to the wild type, in iron-restricted growth medium, whereas no such deficiency was observed during growth in iron-replete medium. Complemented mutants showed a restored ability to grow under iron restriction. We further showed that an sbnE mutant was compromised in a murine kidney abscess model of S. aureus infection, illustrating the importance of siderophore production to the pathogenicity of S. aureus. sbn genes were present in all S. aureus strains tested (and all S. aureus genome sequences) but were undetectable in any of the 13 coagulase-negative staphylococci tested, including Staphylococcus epidermidis.},

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) normally colonizes the upper respiratory mucosa, which is an iron-restricted environment. In contrast, during bacteremia available iron from heme and non-heme proteins potentially increases. In iron-depleted medium pneumococcal strain TIGR4 showed reduced growth, however, addition of several physiological iron sources restored growth. Gene expression of selected known and putative pneumococcal virulence factors was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in response to iron sources in vitro and during colonization, pneumonia, and bacteremia in a mouse model. Change in mRNA levels relative to transcription in iron-depleted medium was reported. In presence of iron sources, transcription of cps4A, zmpA, pavA, hemolysin and a putative exfoliative toxin was significantly increased, but nanB was suppressed. Hemoglobin at physiological concentration repressed ply and pspA expression. Ferritin, an acute phase protein, increased expression of an iron ABC transporter and repressed expression of a bacterial non-heme iron-containing ferritin. Transcription of cps4A, nanB, hemolysin, and a putative exfoliative toxin were significantly up-regulated during pneumonia and bacteremia, while mRNA of pavA and non-heme ferritin were expressed at higher levels during pneumonia and carriage. An iron ABC transporter was most up-regulated during bacteremia, while pspA and ply were expressed only in pneumonia. Transcription of zmpA was elevated during both pneumonia and bacteremia. These findings suggest that a subset of virulence genes in pneumococci is differentially regulated in response to the quantity and form of iron sources available in a host.},

  abstract        = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating progressive disease with limited therapeutic options. Airway macrophages (AMs) are key components of the defense of the airways and are implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF. Alterations in iron metabolism have been described during fibrotic lung disease and in murine models of lung fibrosis. However, the role of transferrin receptor 1 (CD71)-expressing AMs in IPF is not known.   To assess the role of CD71-expressing AMs in the IPF lung.   We used multiparametric flow cytometry, gene expression analysis, and phagocytosis/transferrin uptake assays to delineate the role of AMs expressing or lacking CD71 in the BAL of patients with IPF and of healthy control subjects.   There was a distinct increase in proportions of AMs lacking CD71 in patients with IPF compared with healthy control subjects. Concentrations of BAL transferrin were enhanced in IPF-BAL, and furthermore, CD71  AMs had an impaired ability to sequester transferrin. CD71  and CD71  AMs were phenotypically, functionally, and transcriptionally distinct, with CD71  AMs characterized by reduced expression of markers of macrophage maturity, impaired phagocytosis, and enhanced expression of profibrotic genes. Importantly, proportions of AMs lacking CD71 were independently associated with worse survival, underlining the importance of this population in IPF and as a potential therapeutic target.   Taken together, these data highlight how CD71 delineates AM subsets that play distinct roles in IPF and furthermore show that CD71  AMs may be an important pathogenic component of fibrotic lung disease.},

  abstract        = {To determine whether genetic polymorphisms in several candidate genes related to innate immunity and protease-antiprotease balance modify individual susceptibility to develop asbestos-related fibrotic pleuropulmonary changes. Sixteen polymorphisms from nine genes (NLRP3, CARD8, TNF, TGFB1, GC, MMP1, MMP9, MMP12 and TIMP2) were genotyped from 951 Finnish asbestos-exposed workers. The genotype/haplotype data were compared to signs of fibrosis and pleural thickenings using linear and logistic regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders. A functional polymorphism (Q705K; rs35829419) in the NLRP3 gene was associated with interstitial lung fibrosis (p=0.013), and the TGFB1 rs2241718 SNP with visceral pleural fibrosis (VPF) (p=0.044). In stratified analysis, the carriage of at least one NLRP3 variant allele conferred a 2.5-fold increased risk for pathological interstitial lung fibrosis (OR 2.44, 95% CI 0.97 to 6.14). Conversely, the carriage of at least one TGFB1 rs2241718 variant allele protected against VPF (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.98). The TIMP2 rs2277698 SNP and a haplotype consisting of the TGFB1 rs1800469 and rs1800470 SNPs were associated with the degree of pleural thickening calcification (p=0.037 and p=0.035), and the CARD8 rs2043211 SNP with the greatest thickness of pleural plaques (p=0.015). Our results support the hypothesis that the NLRP3 inflammasome is important in the development of fibrotic lung disease by associating the NLRP3 rs35829419 variant allele with increased risk of asbestos-related interstitial lung fibrosis, and the TGFB1 rs2241718 variant allele with decreased risk of asbestos-related VPF. Polymorphisms in CARD8 and TIMP2 are proposed to modify the development and/or calcification of pleural thickenings.},

  abstract        = {Smoking prevalence is higher amongst individuals with schizophrenia and depression compared with the general population. Mendelian randomisation (MR) can examine whether this association is causal using genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We conducted two-sample MR to explore the bi-directional effects of smoking on schizophrenia and depression. For smoking behaviour, we used (1) smoking initiation GWAS from the GSCAN consortium and (2) we conducted our own GWAS of lifetime smoking behaviour (which captures smoking duration, heaviness and cessation) in a sample of 462690 individuals from the UK Biobank. We validated this instrument using positive control outcomes (e.g. lung cancer). For schizophrenia and depression we used GWAS from the PGC consortium. There was strong evidence to suggest smoking is a risk factor for both schizophrenia (odds ratio (OR) 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67-3.08, p < 0.001) and depression (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.71-2.32, p < 0.001). Results were consistent across both lifetime smoking and smoking initiation. We found some evidence that genetic liability to depression increases smoking (β = 0.091, 95% CI 0.027-0.155, p = 0.005) but evidence was mixed for schizophrenia (β = 0.022, 95% CI 0.005-0.038, p = 0.009) with very weak evidence for an effect on smoking initiation. These findings suggest that the association between smoking, schizophrenia and depression is due, at least in part, to a causal effect of smoking, providing further evidence for the detrimental consequences of smoking on mental health.},

We conduct a large GERD GWAS meta-analysis (80,265 cases, 305,011 controls), identifying 25 independent genome-wide significant loci for GERD. Several of the implicated genes are existing or putative drug targets. Loci discovery is greatest with a broad GERD definition (including cases defined by self-report or medication data). Further, 91% of the GERD risk-increasing alleles also increase BE and/or EA risk, greatly expanding gene discovery for these traits. Our results map genes for GERD and related traits and uncover potential new drug targets for these conditions.},

  abstract        = {Iron is integral to many physiological processes, and variations in its levels, even within the normal range, can have implications for health. The objective of this study was to explore the broad clinical effects of varying iron status. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data obtained from 48,972 European individuals (55% female) across 19 cohorts in the Genetics of Iron Status Consortium were used to identify 3 genetic variants (rs1800562 and rs1799945 in the hemochromatosis gene [HFE] and rs855791 in the transmembrane protease serine 6 gene [TMPRSS6]) that associate with increased serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation and decreased transferrin levels, thus serving as instruments for systemic iron status. Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of these instruments was performed on 424,439 European individuals (54% female) in the UK Biobank who were aged 40-69 years when recruited from 2006 to 2010, with their genetic data linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) from April, 1995 to March, 2016. Two-sample summary data mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to investigate the effect of varying iron status on outcomes across the human phenome. MR-PheWAS analysis for the 3 iron status genetic instruments was performed separately and then pooled by meta-analysis. Correction was made for testing of multiple correlated phenotypes using a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold. Heterogeneity between MR estimates for different instruments was used to indicate possible bias due to effects of the genetic variants through pathways unrelated to iron status. There were 904 distinct phenotypes included in the MR-PheWAS analyses. After correcting for multiple testing, the 3 genetic instruments for systemic iron status demonstrated consistent evidence of a causal effect of higher iron status on decreasing risk of traits related to anemia (iron deficiency anemia: odds ratio [OR] scaled to a standard deviation [SD] increase in genetically determined serum iron levels 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.81, P = 4 × 10-8) and hypercholesterolemia (hypercholesterolemia: OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.93, P = 2 × 10-5) and increasing risk of traits related to infection of the skin and related structures (cellulitis and abscess of the leg: OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.10-1.42, P = 6 × 10-4). The main limitations of this study relate to possible bias from pleiotropic effects of the considered genetic variants and misclassification of diagnoses in the HES data. Furthermore, this work only investigated participants with European ancestry, and the findings may not be applicable to other ethnic groups. Our findings offer novel, to our knowledge, insight into previously unreported effects of iron status, highlighting a potential protective effect of higher iron status on hypercholesterolemia and a detrimental role on risk of skin and skin structure infections. Given the modifiable and variable nature of iron status, these findings warrant further investigation.},

  abstract        = {Cytokines and growth factors have been implicated in the initiation and propagation of vascular disease. Observational studies have shown associations of their circulating levels with stroke. Our objective was to explore whether genetically determined circulating levels of cytokines and growth factors are associated with stroke and its etiologic subtypes by conducting a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Genetic instruments for 41 cytokines and growth factors were obtained from a genome-wide association study of 8293 healthy adults. Their associations with stroke and stroke subtypes were evaluated in the MEGASTROKE genome-wide association study data set (67 162 cases; 454 450 controls) applying inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis, weighted-median analysis, Mendelian randomization-Egger regression, and multivariable Mendelian randomization. The UK Biobank cohort was used as an independent validation sample (4985 cases; 364 434 controls). Genetic instruments for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) were further tested for association with etiologically related vascular traits by using publicly available genome-wide association study data. Genetic predisposition to higher MCP-1 levels was associated with higher risk of any stroke (odds ratio [OR] per 1 SD increase, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09; P=0.0009), any ischemic stroke (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P=0.002), large-artery stroke (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09-1.30; P=0.0002), and cardioembolic stroke (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06-1.23; P=0.0004), but not with small-vessel stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage. The results were stable in sensitivity analyses and remained significant after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Analyses in the UK Biobank showed similar associations for available phenotypes (any stroke: OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.99-1.17; P=0.09; any ischemic stroke: OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.97-1.18; P=0.17). Genetically determined higher MCP-1 levels were further associated with coronary artery disease (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.08; P=0.04) and myocardial infarction (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09; P=0.02), but not with atrial fibrillation. A meta-analysis of observational studies showed higher circulating MCP-1 levels in patients with stroke in comparison with controls. Genetic predisposition to elevated circulating levels of MCP-1 is associated with higher risk of stroke, in particular with large-artery stroke and cardioembolic stroke. Whether targeting MCP-1 or its receptors can lower stroke incidence requires further study.},
